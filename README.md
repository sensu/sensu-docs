# Sensu Docs Site

Welcome to the Sensu Documentation! This is a work in progress as we migrate from our previous project, [sensu/sensu-docs](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site).

## Status

- Pages from site are officially merged into the new docs site: https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site, which is [tracked on these Milestones](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site/milestones)
- The sensuapp.org/docs pages will remain separate until the Launch milestone is hit, tracked here: https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site/milestones

## Why Change?

This new site is a place for:

- Versioned documentation that's easy to navigate
- MUCH FASTER load times
- Full-text search üòç
- Easier contribution experience running Hugo locally

## Project wiki

This document is focused on helping you get started with the sensu-docs-site project as a whole. For detail on formatting, layouts and other aspects of adding to or modifying content, please see our [project wiki](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site/wiki).

## Running Sensu Docs

Unlike the old sensu-docs project, this site can be run locally with Hugo. There's some new steps to learn. Don't worry, we've documented how to do so:

### Getting Started with Hugo

#### Cloning the project

This project uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage themes. If you have git 1.6.5 or later, you can clone this project and checkout submodules in one command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site.git sensu-docs-site
```

If you cloned this repository without the `--recursive` flag, you can manually pull in the theme submodule:
```
cd sensu-docs-site ; git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Installing Hugo

This project requires Hugo version 0.34 or later.

To install Hugo, we recommend heading over to [the Hugo installation docs](http://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) to find the instructions for your platform of choice. If you're in doubt over whether a release exists for your platform, check out [the GitHub releases page for Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) to see available packages. 

Once you've installed Hugo, continue reading for viewing the site and working with Hugo.

#### Building the site

After installing Hugo we suggest that you test the build of the site in your local environment:

```
hugo build
```

This is the same build process used by TravisCI to test changes. If this command produces any errors, please ensure you're using [the same version of Hugo documented in our wiki](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site/wiki/Hugo-version-upgrades).


#### Viewing locally
If the site builds successfully, you can run the Hugo server and view the site in a local web browser:

```
hugo server
```

### Pushing to Github
This is the same as any other project. Follow Github's instructions if you're unsure. No additional steps are needed.

### Deploying to Heroku
This project uses [Travis CI Deployment support for Heroku](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/heroku/) to automatically deploy the site once changes are merged to `master`. For additional details on Heroku configuration and deployment, see [our wiki page](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs-site/wiki/Heroku-Configuration-and-Publishing).
