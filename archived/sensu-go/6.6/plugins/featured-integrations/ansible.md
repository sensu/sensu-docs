## Features

The [Sensu Ansible Handler plugin][4] supports both Ansible Tower and Ansible AWX implementations of the Ansible Tower API, authenticating using Ansible Tower API tokens.  

- Specify a default Ansible Tower job template for remediation actions for all checks and use check annotations to override the default as needed on a check-by check-basis.
- Automatically limit Ansible jobs to the host that matches the Sensu entity name encoded in a Sensu event.
- Optional job template requests: use Sensu check annotations to specify a set of Ansible Tower job template requests to run for matching Sensu event occurrence and severity conditions.
- Keep your Ansible Tower host and auth token secure with Sensu [environment variables and secrets management][9].

## Get the plugin

You can also add the [Sensu Ansible Handler plugin][4] with a dynamic runtime asset from Bonsai, the Sensu asset hub, to build your own workflow or integrate Sensu with your existing Ansible workflows.
[Dynamic runtime assets][5] are shareable, reusable packages that make it easier to deploy Sensu plugins.
