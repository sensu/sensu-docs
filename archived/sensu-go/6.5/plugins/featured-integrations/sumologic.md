The [Sensu Sumo Logic Handler plugin][4] is a Sensu [handler][1] that sends Sensu observability events and metrics to a Sumo Logic [HTTP Logs and Metrics Source][9].
This handler sends Sensu events as log entries, a set of metrics, or both, depending on the mode of operation you specify.

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: The Sensu Sumo Logic Handler plugin is an example of Sensu's time-series and long-term event storage integrations.

## Features

- Query events and metrics points within Sumo Logic: the handler automatically mutates metrics data by creating a top-level object with metric point names and their associated values.
- Tunable arguments: use Sensu annotations to set Sumo Logic source name, host, and category; metric dimensions; log fields; and more.
- Use [event-based templating][2] to include observation data from event attributes to add meaningful, actionable context.
- Keep your Sumo Logic HTTP Logs and Metrics Source URL secure with Sensu [environment variables and secrets management][7].
