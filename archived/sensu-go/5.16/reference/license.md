## Entity limit

Your commercial license includes the entity limit tied to your Sensu licensing package.
An entity limit of `0` allows unlimited entities.
Both agent and proxy entities count toward the overall entity limit.
[Contact Sensu][8] to upgrade your commercial license.

To see your current entity count, use any `/api/core` or `/api/enterprise` [API request][9]. For example:

{{< highlight shell >}}
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/core/v2/namespaces/default/entities -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENSU_ACCESS_TOKEN"
{{< /highlight >}}

Your current entity count and limit are listed as response headers:

{{< highlight shell >}}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Sensu-Entity-Count: 4
Sensu-Entity-Limit: 0
{{< /highlight >}}

## License expiration

To see your commercial license expiration date, [log in to your Sensu account][1].

If your license is within 30 days of expiration, Sensu issues regular warnings in the Sensu [backend logs][6].
If your license expires, you will still have access to [commercial features][5], but your entity limit will drop back down to the free limit of 100.
