## Themes

Use the preferences menu to change the theme or switch to the dark theme.

## Namespaces

The dashboard displays events, entities, checks, and silences for a single namespace at a time.
By default, the dashboard displays the `default` namespace.

**COMMERCIAL FEATURE**: In the packaged Sensu Go distribution, the namespace switcher will list only the namespaces to which the current user has access. For more information, see [Get started with commercial features][6].
