- [Next steps](#next-steps)

A Sensu event handler is an action the Sensu backend executes when a specific [event][1] occurs.
In this guide, you'll use a handler to populate the time series database [InfluxDB][2].
If you're not familiar with handlers, consider reading the [handlers reference][9] before continuing through this guide.

## Use a handler to populate InfluxDB

The example in this guide explains how to populate Sensu metrics into the time series database [InfluxDB][2].
Metrics can be collected from [check output][10] or the [Sensu StatsD Server][3].

### Register the asset

[Assets][12] are shareable, reusable packages that make it easier to deploy Sensu plugins.
This example uses the [Sensu InfluxDB Handler][13] asset to power an `influx-db` handler.

Use [`sensuctl asset add`][5] to register the [Sensu InfluxDB Handler][13] asset:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl asset add sensu/sensu-influxdb-handler:3.1.2 -r influxdb-handler
{{< /highlight >}}

This example uses the `-r` (rename) flag to specify a shorter name for the asset: `influxdb-handler`.

You can also download the latest asset definition for your platform from [Bonsai][13] and register the asset with `sensuctl create --file filename.yml`.

You should see a confirmation message from sensuctl:

{{< highlight shell >}}
Created
{{< /highlight >}}

Run `sensuctl asset list --format yaml` to confirm that the asset is ready to use.

### Create the handler

Now that you have registered the asset, you'll use sensuctl to create a handler called `influx-db` that pipes event data to InfluxDB with the `sensu-influxdb-handler` asset.
Edit the command below to include your database name, address, username, and password.
For more information about the Sensu InfluxDB handler, see [the asset page in Bonsai][13].

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl handler create influx-db \
--type pipe \
--command "sensu-influxdb-handler -d sensu" \
--env-vars "INFLUXDB_ADDR=http://influxdb.default.svc.cluster.local:8086, INFLUXDB_USER=sensu, INFLUXDB_PASS=password" \
--runtime-assets influxdb-handler
{{< /highlight >}}

You should see a confirmation message from sensuctl:

{{< highlight shell >}}
Created
{{< /highlight >}}

### Assign the handler to an event

With the `influx-db` handler created, you can assign it to a check for [check output metric extraction][10]. 
In this example, the check name is `collect-metrics`:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl check set-output-metric-handlers collect-metrics influx-db
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also assign the handler to the [Sensu StatsD listener][3] at agent startup to pass all StatsD metrics into InfluxDB:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensu-agent start --statsd-event-handlers influx-db
{{< /highlight >}}

### Validate the handler

It might take a few moments after you assign the handler to the check or StatsD server for Sensu to receive the metrics, but after an event is handled you should start to see metrics populating InfluxDB.
You can verify proper handler behavior with `sensu-backend` logs.
See [Troubleshooting][8] for log locations by platform.

Whenever an event is being handled, a log entry is added with the message `"handler":"influx-db","level":"debug","msg":"sending event to handler"`,
followed by a second log entry with the message `"msg":"pipelined executed event pipe
handler","output":"","status":0`.
