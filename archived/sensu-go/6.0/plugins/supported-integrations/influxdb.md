The [Sensu InfluxDB Handler plugin][4] is a Sensu [handler][1] that sends Sensu metrics to the time-series database InfluxDB so you can store, instrument, and visualize Sensu metrics data.
You can also use the Sensu InfluxDB Handler integration to create metrics from Sensu status check results for long-term storage in InfluxDB.

**NOTE**: The Sensu InfluxDB Handler plugin is an example of Sensu's time-series and long-term event storage integrations.

## Features

- Transform metrics to InfluxDB format: extract and transform the metrics you collect from different sources in formats like Graphite, OpenTSDB, Nagios, and Influx and populate them into InfluxDB.
- Mutate check status into metrics to be stored in InfluxDB.
- Specify custom values for Sensu event metric points via [metric tags][7].
- Keep your InfluxDB username and password secure with Sensu [environment variables and secrets management][6].

## Get the plugin
