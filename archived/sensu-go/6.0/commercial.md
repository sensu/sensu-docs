Sensu Go offers commercial features designed for monitoring at scale.
All commercial features are available in the official Sensu Go distribution, and you can use them for free [up to an entity limit of 100][7].
If you have more than 100 entities, [contact the Sensu sales team][1] for a free trial.

In addition to the [summary][25] on this page, we describe commercial features in detail throughout the documentation.
Watch for this notice to identify commercial features:

## Commercial features in Sensu Go

- **Integrate your Sensu observability pipeline with industry-standard tools** like ServiceNow and Jira with [supported integrations][24] and [enterprise-tier dynamic runtime assets][11].
- **Manage resources from your browser**: Use the Sensu [web UI][8] to manage events and entities and create, edit, and delete checks, handlers, mutators, silences, and event filters.
- **Control permissions with Sensu role-based access control (RBAC)**, with the option of using [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Active Directory (AD), or OpenID Connect 1.0 protocol (OIDC)][9] for authentication.
- **Use mutual transport layer security (mTLS) authentication** to [provide two-way verification of your Sensu agents and backend connections][21].
- **Protect your sensitive information** with [secrets management][22].
Avoid exposing usernames, passwords, and access keys in your Sensu configuration by integrating with HashiCorp Vault or using Sensu's built-in environment variable secrets provider.
- **Manage your monitoring resources across multiple data centers, cloud regions, or providers** and mirror changes to follower clusters with [federation][20].
Federation affords visibility into the health of your infrastructure and services across multiple distinct Sensu instances within a single web UI.
- **Use powerful filtering capabilities** designed for large installations.
With label and field selectors, you can filter [Sensu API][4] responses, [sensuctl][5] outputs, and Sensu [web UI][6] views using custom labels and a wider range of resource attributes.
Build event filter expressions with [JavaScript execution functions][19].
- **Log observation data** [to a file][10] you can use as an input to your favorite data lake solution.
- **Achieve enterprise-scale event handling** for your Sensu instance with a [PostgreSQL event store][12].
Access the PostgreSQL event datastore with the same Sensu web UI, API, and sensuctl processes as etcd-stored events.
- **Get enterprise-class support**: Rest assured that with [Sensu support][13], help is available if you need it.
Our expert in-house team offers best-in-class support to get you up and running smoothly.
