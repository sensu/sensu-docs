Sensu administrators control access by authentication and authorization.

Authentication verifies user identities to confirm that users are who they say they are.
Sensu requires username and password authentication to access the web UI, API, and sensuctl command line tool.
You can use Sensu's [built-in basic authentication provider][14] or configure [external authentication providers][15].

**NOTE**: For API-specific authentication, see the [API overview](../../api/#access-control) and [Use API keys to authenticate to Sensu](use-apikeys/).
{{% /notice %}}

Authorization establishes and manages user permissions: the extent of access users have for different Sensu resources.
Configure authorization with [role-based access control (RBAC)][4] to exercise fine-grained control over how they interact with Sensu resources.

## Authentication

Sensu web UI and sensuctl command line tool users can authenticate via [built-in basic authentication provider][14] or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Active Directory (AD), or OpenID Connect 1.0 protocol (OIDC) when [external authentication providers][15] are configured by the administrator.

Sensu agents authenticate to the Sensu backend using either [basic][14] or [mutual transport layer security (TLS)][20] authentication.

### Use built-in basic authentication

Sensu's built-in basic authentication provider allows you to create and manage user credentials (usernames and passwords) with the [users API][53], either directly or using [sensuctl][2].
The basic authentication provider does not depend on external services and is not configurable.

Sensu hashes user passwords using the [bcrypt][26] algorithm and records the basic authentication credentials in [etcd][54].

### Use an authentication provider

**COMMERCIAL FEATURE**: Access authentication providers in the packaged Sensu Go distribution.
For more information, see [Get started with commercial features][6].

In addition to built-in authentication, Sensu includes commercial support for authentication using external authentication providers via [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)][44], [Active Directory (AD)][37], or [OpenID Connect 1.0 protocol (OIDC)][7].

#### Configure authentication providers

**1. Write an authentication provider configuration definition**

* Standards-compliant LDAP tools like OpenLDAP: [LDAP configuration examples][29] and [specification][30]
* Microsoft AD, including Azure AD: [AD configuration examples][31] and [specification][32]
* OIDC tools like Okta and PingFederate: [OIDC configuration examples][9] and [specification][12]

**2. Apply the configuration with sensuctl**

Log in to sensuctl as the [default admin user][3] and apply the configuration to Sensu:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl create --file filename.json
{{< /code >}}

Use sensuctl to verify that your provider configuration was applied successfully:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl auth list

 Type     Name    
────── ────────── 
 ldap   openldap  
{{< /code >}}

#### Manage authentication providers

View and delete authentication providers with the [authentication providers API][27] or these sensuctl commands.

To view active authentication providers:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl auth list
{{< /code >}}

To view configuration details for an authentication provider named `openldap`:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl auth info openldap
{{< /code >}}

To delete an authentication provider named `openldap`:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl auth delete openldap
{{< /code >}}

## Authorization

After you set up authentication, configure authorization via [role-based access control (RBAC)][4] to give those users permissions within Sensu.
RBAC allows you to specify actions users are allowed to take against resources, within namespaces or across all namespaces, based on roles bound to the user or to one or more groups the user is a member of.
See [Create a read-only user][5] for an example.

- **Namespaces** partition resources within Sensu.
Sensu entities, checks, handlers, and other [namespaced resources][17] belong to a single namespace.
- **Roles** create sets of permissions (like GET and DELETE) tied to resource types.
**Cluster roles** apply permissions across all namespaces and may include access to [cluster-wide resources][18] like users and namespaces. 
- **Role bindings** assign a role to a set of users and groups within a namespace.
**Cluster role bindings** assign a cluster role to a set of users and groups across all namespaces.

To enable permissions for external users and groups within Sensu, you can create a set of [roles, cluster roles][11], [role bindings, and cluster role bindings][13] that map to the usernames and group names in your authentication provider.

After you configure an authentication provider and establish the roles and bindings to grant authenticated users the desired privileges, those users can log in via [sensuctl][36] and the [web UI][1] using a single-sign-on username and password.
Users do *not* need to provide the username prefix for the authentication provider when logging in to Sensu.
