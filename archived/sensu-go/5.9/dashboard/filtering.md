The Sensu dashboard provides basic filters to build customized views of Sensu resources.
When applied, filters create a unique link, so you can bookmark and share your favorite filter combinations.

- On the **events page**, filter by entity, check, status, and silenced/unsilenced. You can also sort events by severity, last OK, newest, and oldest.
- On the **entities page**, filter by entity class and subscription.
- On the **checks page**, filter by subscription and published/unpublished.
- On the **handlers page**, filter by handler type.
- On the **silences page**, filter by check and subscription. You can also sort silences by start date.
