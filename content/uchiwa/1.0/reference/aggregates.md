To understand aggregates in Sensu, please refer yourself to the
[Sensu documentation](https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/reference/aggregates.html).

## List All Aggregates
To view all aggregates, head over to the *aggregates view*.

## View An Aggregate
To see the detail of a specific aggregate, click on it from the *aggregates view*.
From there, you can see the **check** and **client members**, in addition to the
**results** of every check members.

## Delete An Aggregate
It's currently impossible to delete an aggregate from Uchiwa, but we would love to
have you [contribute][1] to Uchiwa by
implementing this feature!
