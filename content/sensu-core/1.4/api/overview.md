## Sensu API

The Sensu API provides access to monitoring data collected by Sensu, such as
a [client registry][1], [check results][2], and [event data][3]. The API can be
used to request adhoc check executions, and resolve events, among other things.

## RESTful JSON API

The Sensu API is [JSON][4]-based [RESTful API][5]. Familiarity with (or
willingness to Google) industry standard RESTful API behaviors &ndash; including
[HTTP response codes][6] &ndash; are strongly recommended.

## Response Content Filtering

Sensu API endpoints that support the `GET` HTTP method, support HTTP
response content filtering, using one or more filter attributes. To
use response content filtering, construct the URL for your API request
using a dot notation query string parameter beginning with `filter.`,
e.g. `/events?filter.client.environment=production`. The Sensu API will
only return response content objects that match the specified response
content filter attributes. Multiple attributes may be specified for a
request, e.g.
`/events?filter.client.environment=production&filter.check.contact=ops`.
