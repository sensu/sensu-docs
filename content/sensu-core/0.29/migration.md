_**IMPORTANT**: [Sensu Core reached end-of-life (EOL) on December 31, 2019][73]. This guide describes how to migrate your Sensu instance from Sensu Core to Sensu Go. To migrate from Sensu Enterprise, see the [Sensu Enterprise migration guide][30]. Learn more about [Core and Enterprise EOL][85]._

Here's a quick overview of Sensu Go's advantages:

- **Sensu Go is built to scale**, with a powerful, extendable API that gives you flexibility when integrating Sensu with your existing infrastructure.
- **Sensu Go's simplified architecture** means you can deploy Sensu Go in seconds, without the Core dependencies on Redis and RabbitMQ.
- **The Sensu Go agent is smaller**, which allows you to maintain total visibility by deploying Sensu throughout your system.
- **The sensuctl command line interface** allows you to deploy and interact with monitoring checks and assets right from the command line.
- **The Sensu web UI** provides a unified view of your events, entities, and checks with user-friendly tools to reduce alert fatigue.
- **Sensu Go includes flexible access and security options**, including role-based access control (RBAC), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Microsoft's Active Directory (AD), and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.

Read on to learn what you can expect in Sensu Go and how to migrate from Sensu Core.

## Learn about Sensu Go

Sensu Go includes powerful features to make monitoring easier to build, scale, and offer as a self-service tool to your internal customers. 
Read the [Sensu Go introduction][76] for more information about features in Sensu Go.

To set up a local Sensu Go playground, download and start the [Sensu sandbox][80] using Vagrant and VirtualBox.
Get started with Sensu in the [interactive tutorial][32].

Sensu Go is provided as three packages: sensu-go-backend, sensu-go-agent, and sensu-go-cli (sensuctl).
This is a fundamental change in Sensu terminology from Sensu Core: the server is now the backend.

Clients are represented within Sensu Go as abstract entities that can describe a wider range of system components such as network gear, a web server, or a cloud resource.
Entities include agent entities that run a Sensu agent and the familiar proxy entities.

To install Sensu Go alongside your current Sensu instance, you must [upgrade][33] to at least [Sensu Core 1.7.0][34].

### Sensu Go architecture

<img src="/images/install-sensu.png" alt="Sensu architecture diagram">

The [**Sensu backend**][84] is powered by an embedded transport and [etcd][16] datastore and gives you flexible, automated workflows to route metrics and alerts.
Sensu backends require persistent storage for their embedded database, disk space for local asset caching, and three exposed ports:

- `3000` - Sensu [web UI][13]
- `8080` - Sensu [API][41] used by sensuctl, some plugins, and any of your custom tooling
- `8081` - WebSocket API used by Sensu agents

Sensu backends running in a [clustered configuration][14] require additional ports.
See the [deployment guide][deploy] for architecture recommendations.

[**Sensu agents**][83] are lightweight clients that run on the infrastructure components you want to monitor.
Agents automatically register with Sensu as entities and are responsible for creating check and metric events to send to the backend event pipeline.
Agents using Sensu [assets][12] require some disk space for a local cache.
Optionally, agents can expose three ports:

- `3030` - [TCP and UDP sockets][70] designed to be backwards compatible with the Sensu 1.x [client socket][64]
- `3031` - [agent API][50]
- `8125` - [StatsD listener][51]

### Supported platforms

Sensu Go is available for RHEL/CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, and Docker.
The Sensu Go agent is also available for Windows.
[Configuration management][36] integrations for Sensu Go are available for Puppet, Chef, and Ansible.
See the list of [supported platforms][35] for more information.

### Deployment recommendations

See the [deployment][deploy] and [hardware requirements][37] guides for deployment recommendations.

## Step 1: Install Sensu Go

### 1. Install the Sensu Go backend 

The Sensu backend is available for Ubuntu/Debian, RHEL/CentOS, and Docker.
See the [installation guide][52] to install, configure, and start the Sensu backend according to your [deployment strategy][deploy].

### 2. Log in to the Sensu web UI

The [Sensu Go web UI][13] provides a unified view of your monitoring events with user-friendly tools to reduce alert fatigue and manage your Sensu instance.
After starting the Sensu backend, open the web UI by visiting http://localhost:3000.
You may need to replace `localhost` with the hostname or IP address where the Sensu backend is running.

To log in, enter your Sensu user credentials, or use Sensu's default admin credentials (username: `admin` and password: `P@ssw0rd!`).
Select the ☰ icon to explore the web UI.

### 3. Install sensuctl on your workstation

Sensuctl is a command line tool for managing resources within Sensu.
It works by calling Sensu’s HTTP API to create, read, update, and delete resources, events, and entities.
Sensuctl is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
See the [installation guide][54] to install and configure sensuctl.

### 4. Set up Sensu users

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a built-in feature of Sensu Go.
RBAC allows you to manage users and resources and control their access based on namespaces, groups, roles, and bindings.
To learn more about setting up RBAC in Sensu Go, see the [RBAC reference][38] and the [guide to creating a read-only user][39].

In Sensu Go, namespaces partition resources within a Sensu instance.
Sensu Go entities, checks, handlers, and other [namespaced resources][71] belong to a single namespace.
The Sensu translator places all translated resources into the `default` namespace &emdash; we'll use the translater in a moment.

In addition to built-in RBAC, Sensu includes [licensed][40] support for authentication using Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and standards-compliant Lightweight Directory Access Protocol tools like OpenLDAP.

### 5. Install agents

The Sensu agent is available for Ubuntu/Debian, RHEL/CentOS, Windows, and Docker.
See the [installation guide][53] to install, configure, and start Sensu agents.

If you're doing a side-by-side migration, add `api-port` (default: `3031`) and `socket-port` (default: `3030`) to your [agent configuration][62].
This prevents the Sensu Go agent API and socket from conflicting with the Sensu Core client API and socket.
You can also disable these features in the agent configuration using the `disable-socket` and `disable-api` flags.

{{< highlight yml >}}
# agent configuration: /etc/sensu.agent.yml
...
api-port: 4041
socket-port: 4030
...
{{< /highlight >}}

Sensu should now be installed and functional. The next step is to translate your Sensu Core configuration to Sensu Go.

## Step 2: Translate your configuration

The [Sensu translator][18] is a command line tool to help you transfer your Sensu Core checks, handlers, and mutators to Sensu Go.

### 1. Run the translator

Install and run the translator.

{{< highlight shell >}}
# Install dependencies
yum install -q -y rubygems ruby-devel

# Install sensu-translator
gem install sensu-translator

# Translate all config in /etc/sensu/conf.d to Sensu Go and output to /sensu_config_translated
# Option: translate your config in sections according to resource type
sensu-translator -d /etc/sensu/conf.d -o /sensu_config_translated
{{< /highlight >}}

If translation is successful, you should see a few callouts followed by `DONE!`.

{{< highlight shell >}}
Sensu 1.x filter translation is not yet supported
Unable to translate Sensu 1.x filter: only_production {:attributes=>{:check=>{:environment=>"production"}}}
DONE!
{{< /highlight >}}

Combine your config into a sensuctl-readable format.

_**NOTE**: for use with `sensuctl create`, do _not_ use a comma between resource objects in Sensu Go resource definitions in JSON format._

{{< highlight shell >}}
find sensu_config_translated/ -name '*.json' -exec cat {} \; > sensu_config_translated_singlefile.json
{{< /highlight >}}

Most attributes are ready to use as-is, but you'll need to adjust your Sensu Go configuration manually to migrate some of Sensu's features.

_NOTE: To streamline a comparison of your Sensu Core configuration with your Sensu Go configuration, output your current Sensu Core configuration using the API: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4567/settings | jq . > sensu_config_original.json`_

### 2. Translate checks

Review your Sensu Core check configuration for the following attributes, and make the corresponding updates to your Sensu Go configuration.

| Core attribute | Manual updates required in Sensu Go config |
| -------------- | ------------- |
`::: foo :::` | Update the syntax for token substitution from triple colons to double curly braces. For example: `{{ foo }}`
`stdin: true`  | No updates required. Sensu Go checks accept data on stdin by default.
`handlers: default` | Sensu Go does not have a default handler. Create a handler named `default` to continue using this pattern.
`subdues` | Check subdues are not available in Sensu Go.
`standalone: true` | Standalone checks are not supported in Sensu Go, although you can achieve similar functionality using [role-based access control, assets, and entity subscriptions][26]. The translator assigns all Core standalone checks to a `standalone` subscription in Sensu Go. Configure one or more Sensu Go agents with the `standalone` subscription to execute formerly standalone checks.
`metrics: true` | See the [translate metric checks](#translate-metric-checks) section.
`proxy_requests` | See the [translate proxy requests](#translate-proxy-requests-and-proxy-entities) section.
`subscribers: roundrobin...` | Remove `roundrobin` from the subscription name, and add the `round_robin` check attribute set to `true`.
`aggregate` | Check aggregates are supported through the [license-activated][40] [Sensu Go Aggregate Check Plugin][28].
`hooks` | See the [translate hooks](#translate-hooks) section.
`dependencies`| Check dependencies are not available in Sensu Go.

_PRO TIP: When using **token substitution** in Sensu Go and accessing labels or annotations that include `.` (for example: `sensu.io.json_attributes`), use the `index` function. For example, `{{index .annotations "web_url"}}` substitutes the value of the `web_url` annotation; `{{index .annotations "production.ID"}}` substitutes the value of the `production.ID` annotation._

#### Translate metric checks

The Sensu Core `type: metric` attribute is not part of the Sensu Go check spec, so you’ll need to adjust it manually.
Sensu Core checks could be configured as `type: metric`, which told Sensu to always handle the check regardless of the check status output.
This allowed Sensu Core to process output metrics via a handler even when the check status was not in an alerting state.

Sensu Go treats output metrics as first-class objects, so you can process check status as well as output metrics via different event pipelines.
See the [guide to metric output][48] to update your metric checks with the `output_metric_handlers` and `output_metric_format` attributes.

#### Translate proxy requests and proxy entities

See the [guide to monitoring external resources][47] to re-configure `proxy_requests` attributes and update your proxy check configuration.
See the [entity reference][6] to re-create your proxy client configurations as Sensu Go proxy entities.

#### Translate hooks

Check hooks are now a resource type in Sensu Go, so you can create, manage, and reuse hooks independently of check definitions.
You can also execute multiple hooks for any given response code.
See the [guide][55] and [hooks reference docs][8] to re-create your Sensu Core hooks as Sensu Go hook resources. 

#### Custom attributes

Custom check attributes are not supported in Sensu Go.
Instead, Sensu Go allows you to add custom labels and annotations to entities, checks, assets, hooks, filters, mutators, handlers, and silences.
The translator stores all check extended attributes in the check metadata annotation named `sensu.io.json_attributes`. 
See the [check reference][56] for more information about using labels and annotations in check definitions.

### 3. Translate filters

Ruby eval logic used in Sensu Core filters is replaced with JavaScript expressions in Sensu Go, opening up powerful possibilities to combine filters with [filter assets][65].
As a result, you'll need to rewrite your Sensu Core filters in Sensu Go format.

First, review your Core handlers to identify which filters are being used. Then, follow the [filter reference][57] and [guide to using filters][58] to re-write your filters using Sensu Go expressions and [event data][66]. Check out the [blog post on filters][59] for a deep dive into Sensu Go filter capabilities.

{{< highlight shell >}}
# Sensu Core hourly filter
{
  "filters": {
    "recurrences": {
      "attributes": {
        "occurrences": "eval: value == 1 || value % 60 == 0"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Sensu Go hourly filter
  {
    "metadata": {
      "name": "hourly",
      "namespace": "default"
    },
    "action": "allow",
    "expressions": [
      "event.check.occurrences == 1 || event.check.occurrences % (3600 / event.check.interval) == 0"
    ],
    "runtime_assets": null
  }
{{< /highlight >}}

### 4. Translate handlers

In Sensu Go, all check results are considered events and are processed by event handlers.
Use the built-in [incidents filter][9] to recreate the Sensu Core behavior, in which only check results with a non-zero status are considered events.

**NOTE**: Silencing is disabled by default in Sensu Go and must be explicitly enabled using the built-in [`not_silenced` filter][15]. Add the `not_silenced` filter to any handlers for which you want to enable Sensu's silencing feature.

Review your Sensu Core check configuration for the following attributes, and make the corresponding updates to your Sensu Go configuration.

| Core attribute | Manual updates required in Sensu Go config |
| -------------- | ------------- |
`filters: occurrences` | The built-in occurrences filter in Sensu Core is not available in Sensu Go, but you can replicate its functionality with the [sensu-go-fatigue-check-filter asset][67].
`type: transport` | Transport handlers are not supported in Sensu Go, but you can create similar functionality with a pipe handler that connects to a message bus and injects event data into a queue.
`filters: check_dependencies` | Sensu Go does not include a built-in check dependencies filter.
`severities` | Severities are not available in Sensu Go.
`handle_silenced` | Silencing is disabled by default in Sensu Go and must be explicitly enabled using the built-in [`not_silenced` filter][15].
`handle_flapping` | All check results are considered events in Sensu Go and are processed by event handlers.

### 5. Upload your config to your Sensu Go instance

After you review your translated configuration, make any necessary updates, and add resource definitions for any filters and entities you want to migrate, you can upload your Sensu Go config using sensuctl.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl create --file /path/to/config.json
{{< /highlight >}}

_PRO TIP: `sensuctl create` (and `sensuctl delete`) are powerful tools to help you manage your Sensu configs across namespaces. See the [sensuctl reference][5] for more information._

Access your Sensu Go config using the [Sensu API][61].

{{< highlight shell >}}
# Set up a local API testing environment by saving your Sensu credentials
# and token as environment variables. Requires curl and jq.
export SENSU_USER=admin && SENSU_PASS=P@ssw0rd!

export SENSU_TOKEN=`curl -XGET -u "$SENSU_USER:$SENSU_PASS" -s http://localhost:8080/auth | jq -r ".access_token"`

# Return list of all configured checks
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENSU_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/core/v2/namespaces/default/checks

# Return list of all configured handlers
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENSU_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/core/v2/namespaces/default/handlers
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also access your Sensu Go configuration in JSON or YAML using sensuctl.
For example, `sensuctl check list --format json`.
Run `sensuctl help` to see available commands.
For more information about sensuctl's output formats (`json`, `wrapped-json`, and `yaml`), see the [sensuctl reference][5].

## Step 3: Translate plugins and register assets

### Sensu plugins

Within the [Sensu Plugins][21] org, see individual plugin READMEs for compatibility status with Sensu Go.
For handler and mutators plugins, see the [Sensu plugins README][46] to map event data to the [Sensu Go format][68].
This allows you to use Sensu plugins for handlers and mutators with Sensu Go without re-writing them.

To re-install Sensu plugins onto your Sensu Go agent nodes (check plugins) and backend nodes (mutator and handler plugins), see the [guide][22] to installing the `sensu-install` tool for use with Sensu Go.

### Sensu Go assets

[Assets][12] are shareable, reusable packages that make it easy to deploy Sensu plugins.
Although assets are not required to run Sensu Go, we recommend [using assets to install plugins][45] where possible.
Sensu supports runtime assets for checks, filters, mutators, and handlers.
Discover, download, and share assets with [Bonsai][69], the Sensu asset index.

To create your own assets, see the [asset reference][12] and [guide to sharing an asset on Bonsai][72].
To contribute to converting a Sensu plugin to an asset, see [the Discourse post][44].

## Step 4: Sunset your Sensu Core instance

When you're ready to sunset your Sensu Core instance, see the [platform][43] docs to stop the Sensu Core services.
You may also want to re-install the `sensu-install` tool using the [`sensu-plugins-ruby` package][22].
