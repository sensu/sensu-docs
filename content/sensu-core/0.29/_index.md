Sensu is the open source monitoring event pipeline built to reduce operator burden and make developers and business owners happy.
Started in 2011, Sensuâ€™s flexible approach solves the challenges of monitoring hybrid-cloud and ephemeral infrastructures with scalable, automated workflows and integrations with tools you already use.

**Automate your monitoring workflows**: Limitless pipelines let you validate and correlate events, mutate data formats, send alerts, manage incidents, collect and store metrics, and more.

**Reduce alert fatigue**: Sensu gives you full control over your alerts with flexible filters, context-rich notifications, reporting, event handling, and auto-remediation.

**Integrate anywhere**: Sensu's open architecture makes it easy to integrate monitoring with tools you already use like Nagios plugins, Chef, Graphite, InfluxDB, and PagerDuty.

### Monitoring for Your Infrastructure

> Monitoring is the action of observing and checking the behaviors and outputs of a system and its components over time. - [Greg Poirier, Monitorama 2016](https://vimeo.com/173610062)

Sensu is an agent-based monitoring tool that you install on your organization's infrastructure.
The Sensu client gives you visibility into everything you care about; the Sensu server gives you flexible, automated workflows to route metrics and alerts.

- **Monitor containers, instances, applications, and on-premises infrastructure**

Sensu is designed to monitor everything from the server closet to the cloud.
[Install the Sensu client][15] on the hosts you want to monitor, integrate with the [Sensu API][16], or take advantage of [proxy clients][17] to monitor anything on your network.
Sensu clients automatically register and de-register themselves with the Sensu server, so you can monitor ephemeral infrastructure without getting overloaded with alerts.

- **Better incident response with filterable, context-rich alerts**

Get meaningful alerts when and where you need them.
Use [event filters][18] to reduce noise and [check hooks][19] to add context and speed up incident response.
Sensu integrates with the tools and services your organization already uses like [PagerDuty][1], [Slack][2], and more.
Check out the [200+ plugins shared by the Sensu community][3], or write your own [Sensu Plugins][4] in any language.

- **Collect metrics and generate alerts with the same tool**

Know what's going on everywhere in your system.
Use the Sensu client to collect metrics alongside check results, then use the event pipeline to route the data to industry-standard tools like Graphite or InfluxDB.

- **Intuitive API and dashboard interfaces**

Sensu integrates automatically with the open source [Uchiwa dashboard][20] to provide a unified view of your clients, checks, and events, as well as a user-friendly silencing tool.
The Sensu [API][16] allows you (and your internal customers) to create checks, register clients, manage configuration, and more.

- **Open source software backed by Sensu Inc.**
