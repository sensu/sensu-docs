## What is the Sensu server?

The Sensu server schedules and publishes [check execution requests][1] to
[client subscriptions][2] (via a [Publish/Subscribe model][3]), and provides a
scalable [event processing platform][4] for processing check results and
monitoring events.

## Sensu Core vs Sensu Enterprise

The Sensu server comes in two flavors: the open-source [Sensu Core][5] (via the
`sensu-server` process), and [Sensu Enterprise][6] (via the `sensu-enterprise`
process). To learn more about the differences between Sensu Core and Sensu
Enterprise, [please visit the Sensu website][7].

_NOTE: Sensu Enterprise (i.e. the `sensu-enterprise` process) was designed to be
a drop-in replacement for the Sensu Core server and API (i.e. the `sensu-server`
and `sensu-api`). As such, any mention of "the Sensu server" in the Sensu
documentation also applies to the `sensu-enterprise` process, for Sensu
Enterprise users._

_WARNING: as noted above, the `sensu-enterprise` process is designed to replace
both of the Sensu Core `sensu-server` and `sensu-api` processes. Because Sensu
Enterprise will load the same configuration as Sensu Core, it is important that
the Sensu Core processes are stopped before starting Sensu Enterprise to avoid
known conflicts and processing errors such as attempting to bind on the same
ports, etc._

## Check execution scheduling

Check execution scheduling is performed by a Sensu server (see [Sensu
server task election][8]). Checks are scheduled by querying Sensu's
configuration for defined checks &ndash; excluding check with the
attributes `"standalone": true` or `"publish": false` &ndash; and
calculating when executions should occur based on their defined
`interval`s.

### Check scheduling algorithm & synchronization {#check-scheduling-algorithm--synchronization}

Sensu uses an internal algorithm for determining a unique "cadence" for Sensu
checks, which uniqueness is based on the check name and `interval`. This
algorithm outputs a value in milliseconds which the Sensu server will use as an
offset before the next check request should be published. In practice, this
means that &ndash; assuming system clocks are in sync between disparate Sensu
servers &ndash; check requests for a given check (based on the check name) will
be published at the <abbr title="typically accurate within 500ms">exact same
time</abbr>. The also means that in the event of a Sensu server restart and/or
Sensu server task re-election (i.e. if a new Sensu server is elected
to become reponsible for check execution scheduling), check execution
scheduling intervals will remain consistent.

In fact, because this algorithm is also shared by the Sensu client &ndash; which
provides decentralized check execution scheduling in the form of [standalone
checks][22] &ndash; a check defined on the Sensu server and a matching
standalone check defined on a Sensu client should also stay in sync with each
other (again assuming that system clocks are in sync, and the check names and
`interval`s are consistent).

## Event processing

The Sensu server provides a scalable event processor. Event processing involves
conversion of [check results][9] into Sensu events, and then
applying any defined [event filters][10], [event data mutators][11],
and [event handlers][12]. All event processing happens on a Sensu server
system.

The event processing workflow happens in the following order:

> **Event** -> **Filters** -> **Mutator** -> **Handler**

_NOTE: events that are filtered out (i.e. removed) by Sensu [event
filters](../filters) will not continue to be mutated by [event data
mutators](../mutators) or [event handlers](../handlers)._

Sensu's event processing capabilities can be distributed among multiple Sensu
servers in a Sensu cluster. For more information on configuring a Sensu cluster,
please see [Scaling Sensu][13] (below).

## Automated task election

The Sensu server processes (i.e. `sensu-server` and
`sensu-enterprise`) are designed to [scale horizontally][14] (i.e. by
adding systems). No additional configuration is required to run a
cluster of Sensu servers, other than the location of the
[transport][15] and [data store][16]. When Sensu servers start, they
participate in an election process to automatically distribute tasks.
A Sensu server may be elected for more than one task. A server task
can only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically
failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or
restart.

All Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster monitor the state of task
execution on a 10-second interval, automatically electing a new Sensu
server for a task if the current one hasn't confirmed execution in
more than 30 seconds.

### Server tasks

In a Sensu server cluster, responsibility for a distinct set of tasks
is distributed amongst members of the cluster. The tasks only run on
one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another
Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart. When adding
Sensu servers to a cluster, restarting the existing Sensu servers in
the cluster will force a redistribution of tasks.

- **Check request publisher**. The Sensu server is responsible for
  publishing check requests to the transport for all configured
  checks. See [check execution scheduling][18] for more information.
- **Client monitor**. The Sensu server is responsible for monitoring
  the [client registry][19] and creating [client keepalive events][20]
  for stale clients.
- **Check result monitor**. The Sensu server is responsible for
  monitoring check results and creating TTL events for check results
  with expired [check TTLs][21]
- **Check result aggregation pruning**. The Sensu server is
  responsible for monitoring check aggregates and pruning stale
  aggregate results.

To observe which Sensu server is currently reponsible for one or more
tasks, see [API /info][23].
