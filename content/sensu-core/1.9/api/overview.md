## Sensu API

The Sensu API provides access to monitoring data collected by Sensu, such as
a [client registry][1], [check results][2], and [event data][3]. The API can be
used to request adhoc check executions, and resolve events, among other things.

## RESTful JSON API

The Sensu API is [JSON][4]-based [RESTful API][5]. Familiarity with (or
willingness to Google) industry standard RESTful API behaviors &ndash; including
[HTTP response codes][6] &ndash; are strongly recommended.

## Response Content Filtering

Sensu API endpoints that support the `GET` HTTP method support HTTP
response content filtering on one or more Sensu attributes.
To use response content filtering, construct the URL for your API request
using a dot notation query beginning with `filter`.

For example, to return only events that match the `production` environment and `ops` contact, use the following request.

{{< highlight shell >}}
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:4567/events?filter.client.environment=production&filter.check.contact=ops'
{{< /highlight >}}

Response filtering is only available for string values; integers (for example: `filter.check.status=2`) are not supported.

## Response Content Pagination {#pagination}
By default, the Sensu API will return all available results, but sometimes this result can be massive.
To paginate the returned result, the `limit` and `offset` query string parameters can be used.
This method also sets the "X-Pagination" HTTP response header to a JSON object containing the `limit`, `offset`, and `total` number of items that are being paginated.

parameters  |  description
------------|----------
limit       |  The number of items to return
offset      |  The number of items to offset before returning.

### Examples
The following example demonstrates a /clients API query with limit=1 and offset=1.
{{< highlight shell >}}
$ curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:4567/clients?limit=1&offset=1'
