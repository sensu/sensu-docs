newer ([on Erlang version 19.3 or newer][4])._

## Install Erlang (the RabbitMQ runtime) {#install-erlang}

RabbitMQ runs on the [Erlang runtime][1], so before you can install and run
RabbitMQ, you'll need to install Erlang.

Although Erlang runtime packages are included in the RPM repositories
for most distributions, the included versions often lag behind
what is supported by RabbitMQ releases. Per the [RabbitMQ Erlang
version requirements documentation][9]:

> Erlang/OTP versions older than 19.3 are not supported by currently
> maintained RabbitMQ release series.

As a result, you will probably get better results installing a newer
version of Erlang from an alternative source.
Please see the [Erlang version requirements documentation][9]
for information on selecting and installing a compatible version of
the Erlang runtime.

## Install RabbitMQ

Although RabbitMQ packages are included in the RPM-based distribution
repositories, the included versions often lag behind the supported
RabbitMQ release series.

Please see the [official RabbitMQ installation guide][2] for
recommended installation strategies.

## Managing the RabbitMQ service/process {#managing-the-rabbitmq-serviceprocess}

1. Install the RabbitMQ init scripts using the [`chkconfig` utility][5]:
   {{< highlight shell >}}
sudo chkconfig rabbitmq-server on{{< /highlight >}}

2. Start and stop the RabbitMQ service using the installed init scripts:
   _NOTE: The `service` command will not work on CentOS 5, the
   sysvinit script must be used, e.g. `sudo /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server start`_
   {{< highlight shell >}}
sudo service rabbitmq-server start
sudo service rabbitmq-server stop{{< /highlight >}}

## Configure RabbitMQ access controls

Access to RabbitMQ is restricted by [access controls][6] (e.g. username and
password). For Sensu services to connect to RabbitMQ a RabbitMQ virtual host
(`vhost`) and user credentials will need to be created.

### Create a dedicated RabbitMQ `vhost` for Sensu

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost /sensu{{< /highlight >}}

### Create a RabbitMQ user for Sensu

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user sensu secret
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /sensu sensu ".*" ".*" ".*"{{< /highlight >}}

## Configure system limits on Linux

By default, most Linux operating systems will limit the maximum number of file
handles a single process is allowed to have open to `1024`. RabbitMQ recommends
adjusting this number to `65536` for production systems, and at least `4096` for
development environments.

> RabbitMQ installations running production workloads may need system limits and
  kernel parameters tuning in order to handle a decent number of concurrent
  connections and queues. The main setting that needs adjustment is the max
  number of open files, also known as `ulimit -n`. The default value on many
  operating systems is too low for a messaging broker (eg. 1024 on several Linux
  distributions). We recommend allowing for at least 65536 file descriptors for
  user `rabbitmq` in production environments. 4096 should be sufficient for most
  development workloads.
>
> There are two limits in play: the maximum number of open files the OS kernel
  allows (`fs.file-max`) and the per-user limit (`ulimit -n`). The former must be
  higher than the latter.

  _Source: [rabbitmq.com][2]_

To adjust this limit, please edit the configuration file found at
`/etc/defaults/rabbitmq-server` by uncommenting the last line in the file, and
adjusting the ulimit value to the recommendation corresponding to the
environment where RabbitMQ is running.

{{< highlight shell >}}
# This file is sourced by the rabbitmq-server service script. Its primary
# reason for existing is to allow adjustment of system limits for the
# rabbitmq-server process.
#
# Maximum number of open file handles. This will need to be increased
# to handle many simultaneous connections. Refer to the system
# documentation for ulimit (in man bash) for more information.
#
ulimit -n 65536{{< /highlight >}}

### Verifying the Limit

To verify that the RabbitMQ open file handle limit has been increase, please
run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
rabbitmqctl status{{< /highlight >}}

## Configure Sensu

The following Sensu configuration files are provided as examples. Please review
the [RabbitMQ reference documentation][7] for additional information on
configuring Sensu to communicate with RabbitMQ, and the [reference documentation
on Sensu configuration][8] for more information on how Sensu loads
configuration.

### Example Standalone Configuration

1. Copy the following contents to a configuration file located at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json`:
  {{< highlight json >}}
{
  "rabbitmq": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5672,
    "vhost": "/sensu",
    "user": "sensu",
    "password": "secret"
  }
}{{< /highlight >}}

### Example Distributed Configuration

1. Obtain the IP address of the system where RabbitMQ is installed. For the
   purpose of this example, we will assume `10.0.1.6` is our IP address.

2. Create a configuration file  with the following contents at
   `/etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json` on the Sensu server and API system(s), and
   all systems running the Sensu client:
  {{< highlight json >}}
{
  "rabbitmq": {
    "host": "10.0.1.6",
    "port": 5672,
    "vhost": "/sensu",
    "user": "sensu",
    "password": "secret"
  }
}{{< /highlight >}}
