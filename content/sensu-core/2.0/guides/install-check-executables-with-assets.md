## What are assets?
Sensu assets are resources that checks can specify as dependencies. When an
agent runs a check, it will ensure that all of the check's required assets
are available to the agent during check runtime. If they aren't, the agent will
install them by consulting each of the assets' URLs.

## Why use assets?
When configuration management is unavailable, assets can help manage runtime 
dependencies such as scripts (e.g. check-haproxy.sh) and tar files (e.g. sensu-ruby-runtime.tar.gz)
entirely within sensu. 

## How to create a check that depends on an asset 

### Creating an asset
In this example, we'll create an asset from a `tar` archive, and show you how to
create a new check with that asset as a dependency, as well as apply it to an
existing check. To create an asset, we'll need a name, a URL to the asset location, 
and a `SHA-512 checksum`.
{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sensuctl asset create check_website.tar.gz \
  -u http://example.com/check_website.tar.gz \
  --sha512 "$(sha512sum check_website.tar.gz | cut -f1 -d ' ')"
{{< /highlight >}}

If you're using a mac, you'll need to use `$(shasum -a 512 check_website.tar.gz | cut -f1 -d ' ') to generate a checksum.


### Adding an asset to a check on creation

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sensuctl check create check_website \
  --command check_website -a www.example.com -C 3000 -w 1500 
  --subscriptions web \
  --interval 10 \
  --runtime-assets check_website.tar.gz 
{{< /highlight >}}

### Adding an asset to an existing check's dependencies

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl check set-runtime-assets check_website.tar.gz 
{{< /highlight >}}

This command will set a check's assets to `check_website.tar.gz`.

### Validating the asset

Once the check is setup, it should only take a few moments for it to be
scheduled and start emitting events. When the check has been scheduled, you should 
see a log entry for that check's execution.
{{< highlight shell >}}
{"component":"agent","level":"info","msg":"scheduling check execution: check_website","time":"2018-04-06T20:46:32Z"}
{{</ highlight >}}
You can verify that the asset is working by using `sensuctl` to list the most recent events:
{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sensuctl event list
    Entity           Check                     Output               Status   Silenced             Timestamp
 ───────────── ────────────────── ──────────────────────────────── ──────── ────────── ───────────────────────────────
  sensu-agent    check_website      CheckHttpResponseTime OK: 345      0       false    2018-04-06 20:38:34 +0000 UTC
{{</ highlight >}}
