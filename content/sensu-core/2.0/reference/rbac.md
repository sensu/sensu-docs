## How does Role Based Access Control work?
Sensu RBAC allows management and access of users and resources based on a heirarchy of *organizations*, *environments*, *roles*, *rules*, and *users*. Each `environment` belongs to only one `organization`, and each `resource` (user, check, asset, etc) belongs to only one `environment`. A Sensu installation can have multiple organizations, each with their own set of environments and resources belonging to them.

### Authentication

Sensu 2.0 offers local users management. Users can be managed with `sensuctl`.

## Terminology

### Organization

An organization is the top-level resource for RBAC. Each organization can
contain one or multiple environments. Sensu ships with a `default` organization.

### Group

### Role

A role contains a set of rules, which represent permissions to Sensu resources.
Roles can be assigned to one or multiple users. Each user can be a member of one
or multiple roles. Users inherit all of the permissions from each role they are
in.

The initial installation of Sensu includes an initial `admin` role that gives a
user associated with it full access to the system.

### Resource Types

A resource type is the resource that a rule acts on. 

| Type | Description |

| `checks` | Manage check resources within a given organization & environment |
| `entities` | Manage entity resources within a given organization & environment |
| `environment` | Create and remove environments |
