This guide will walk you through an example on how to pre-compile Sensu Plugins for distribution among clients.
The goal of this guide is to showcase how you can quickly install plugins on ephemeral instances where time to compile can affect time to production.
We'll be using `sensu-plugins-aws` as it requires `nokogiri`,  usually requiring a longer build time.

## Prerequisites

Sources:

* [GitHub - luislavena/gem-compiler: A RubyGems plugin that generates binary gems](https://github.com/luislavena/gem-compiler)

This guide assumes the following:

* Centos 7 platform
* You have some way to store these artifacts and make them available for systems in your environment

_NOTE: Compiled gems are tied to the Ruby version they are compiled for. If Sensu upgrades Ruby 2.4 -> Ruby 2.5, packages will need to be rebuilt._
_NOTE: Compiled gems are tied to CPU architecture for which they are compiled on._

## Installing the build toolchain

First we'll add the Sensu yum repository definition and install Sensu.

{{< highlight shell >}}
printf '[sensu]
name=sensu
baseurl=https://eol-repositories.sensuapp.org/yum/$releasever/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/sensu.repo && sudo yum install -y sensu{{< /highlight >}}

Then install EPEL, dev tools, and libs required for the next steps.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
# installing dependencies for nokogiri
sudo yum install -y libxml2 libxslt libxslt-devel libxml2-devel gcc ruby-devel zlib-devel{{< /highlight >}}

## Installing a gem to a tmp directory

Install the gem-compiler package:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem install gem-compiler{{< /highlight >}}

We'll now install the source gems into a cache directory.

{{< highlight shell >}}
mkdir /tmp/gems
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --install-dir /tmp/gems sensu-plugins-aws --version '=12.3.0'
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --install-dir /tmp/gems mini_portile2 --version '=2.3.0'{{< /highlight >}}

Observing the `gem install` output, we can see that nokogiri and unf_ext both build native extensions.
These are the gems we will compile so we can install them from our own repository.

### Compile the gems for packaging

We'll use `gem-compiler` to rebuild the gem packages with the included native extensions:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cd /tmp/gems/cache
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem compile unf_ext-0.0.7.5.gem
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem compile nokogiri-1.8.5.gem --prune -- --use-system-libraries{{< /highlight >}}

_NOTE: `nokogiri` requires --prune flag per gem-compiler readme notes_
_NOTE: For `nokogiri` we also use `-- --use-system-libraries` so `gem compile` uses the system gcc and lib's installed earlier_


The resulting compiled gem files have a x86_64-linux in their file name denoting their system architecture:

{{< highlight shell >}}
# ls  -1 *-x86_64-linux.gem
nokogiri-1.8.5-x86_64-linux.gem
unf_ext-0.0.7.5-x86_64-linux.gem{{< /highlight >}}

## Install Pre-Compiled Gems on Targeted System and Testing

### Install compiled gem into embedded Ruby

Now we can copy these gems to another system and install them into the Sensu embedded ruby.
In a production or development environment, you'd want to put these in a rubygems server of your own (e.g. [Geminabox(https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox), [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) or similar). You can also use a tool like `fpm` to convert the gems into a system package.

Here we've copied the compiled gems to a system with Sensu installed, but no gcc or other compile toolchain.

 _NOTE: nokogiri needs libxml2 and libxslt to be present on your system._

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem install unf_ext-0.0.7.5-x86_64-linux.gem
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem install nokogiri-1.8.5-x86_64-linux.gem{{< /highlight >}}

### Install pre-complied Sensu plugins
With these prerequisites in place we can install sensu-plugins-aws without a compiler. You can use `sensu-install` or `gem` commands:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/gem -p aws
[SENSU-INSTALL] installing Sensu plugins ...
[SENSU-INSTALL] determining if Sensu gem 'sensu-plugins-aws' is already installed ...
false
[SENSU-INSTALL] Sensu plugin gems to be installed: ["sensu-plugins-aws"]

Successfully installed sensu-plugins-aws-10.0.3
7 gems installed
[SENSU-INSTALL] successfully installed Sensu plugins: ["sensu-plugins-aws"]{{< /highlight >}}

To test our pre-compiled gems we can use `check-elb-health-fog.rb` as it should exercise the nokogiri dependency:
_NOTE: This is to demonstrate that there are no errors while executing the plugin._

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=fatchance
sudo export AWS_SECRET_KEY=noway
sudo /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/check-elb-health-fog.rb -n foo -r us-east-1
ELBHealth WARNING: An issue occurred while communicating with the AWS EC2 API:
There is no ACTIVE Load Balancer named 'foo'{{< /highlight >}}

## Recap

In this guide we covered the components involved in building out Sensu pre-compiled plugins. This allows system builders a method to pre-compile gems for systems that you may not want all the build tools required installed on them or for an easy to ship package for deploying gems on systems that may not have access to the internet.
