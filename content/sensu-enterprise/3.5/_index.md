### Monitoring for Your Infrastructure

> Monitoring is the action of observing and checking the behaviors and outputs of a system and its components over time. - [Greg Poirier, Monitorama 2016](https://vimeo.com/173610062)

Sensu Enterprise is an agent-based monitoring tool that you install on your organization's infrastructure.
The Sensu client gives you visibility into everything you care about; the Sensu Enterprise server gives you flexible, automated workflows to route metrics and alerts; and the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard gives you a heads-up-display view into the state of your systems.

- **Monitor containers, instances, applications, and on-premises infrastructure**

Sensu Enterprise is designed to monitor everything from the server closet to the cloud.
[Install the Sensu client][14] on the hosts you want to monitor, integrate with the [Sensu Enterprise API][15], or take advantage of [proxy clients][16] to monitor anything on your network.
Sensu clients automatically register and de-register themselves with the Sensu server, so you can monitor ephemeral infrastructure without getting overloaded with alerts.

- **Better incident response with filterable, context-rich alerts**

Get meaningful alerts when and where you need them.
Use [event filters][17] to reduce noise and [check hooks][19] to add context and speed up incident response.
Sensu Enterprise includes built-in integrations with the tools and services your organization already uses like [PagerDuty][20], [Slack][21], and more.

- **Collect and store metrics with built-in support for industry-standard tools**

Know what's going on everywhere in your system.
Sensu Enterprise collects metrics in [industry-standard formats][26] (like Nagios performance data) and automatically translates the data for storage in Graphite, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, and more.

- **Reduce mean time to recovery with contact routing**

Every incident or outage has an ideal first responder, a team or individual with the knowledge to triage and address the issue. Sensu Enterprise [contact routing][23] makes it possible to assign events to specific teams and individuals, reducing mean time to incident response and recovery.

- **Intuitive API and dashboard interfaces with scalable access control**

Sensu Enterprise includes a [dashboard][18] to aggregate monitoring data across multiple environments, providing a unified view.
The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard delivers visibility at scale with comprehensive and granular [role-based access controls][25] featuring support for LDAP, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and GitLab authentication.
