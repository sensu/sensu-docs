## Upgrading from Sensu Core to Sensu Enterprise

For those already running Sensu Core, Sensu Enterprise is designed to be a
drop-in replacement for the Sensu Core server and API. Once installed,
no configuration changes are required â€“ first terminate the
`sensu-server` and `sensu-api` processes, then start the `sensu-enterprise`
process to resume operation of your Sensu instance. Some configuration
changes may be required to take advantage of [built-in integrations][4]
or added-value features like [contact routing][5].
