### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-3-0-changes}

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The OpsGenie integration now supports [OpsGenie's European
  service region][og-eu]. See the [OpsGenie integration docs][og] to configure
  the `api_endpoint` attribute.

Built on [Sensu Core 1.6.1][core-v1-6-1]:

- **NEW**: The [Checks API][64] now provides an endpoint to delete check history and
  check results, giving you an easy way to clean up unused checks.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu Core 1.6 implements changes in RabbitMQ communication
  by using two discrete connections to the transport instead of two channels
  on a single connection, thereby doubling the number of concurrent connections
  RabbitMQ receives. This change prevents check result processing rates from
  being impacted by check execution request publishing rates and reduces the
  possibility of false keepalive alerts under certain conditions. To support
  the increased number of concurrent connections, we recommend making sure
  the open file limit is configured according to RabbitMQ's guidelines for
  [Ubuntu/Debian][65] and [RHEL/CentOS][66].

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu now redacts additional fields (such as webhook URLs)
  when displaying configuration files.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Commands in check results from proxy clients can often contain
  sensitive information following token substitution. Clients now reset
  commands to remove tokens before publishing check results, providing
  better handling for sensitive information.

- **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug impacting macOS packages using Ruby 2.4.4.

- **BUGFIX**: Fixed an issue impacting FreeBSD packages causing incompatibility with newer compilers.

- **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug impacting the installation process for Solaris 10 packages.

  from unconfigured integration tags in check and client definitions.

## Enterprise 3.2.0 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-2-0}

**October 10, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.2.0 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-2-0-changes}

- **NEW**: Sensu Enterprise 3.2 includes a built-in integration with TimescaleDB.
  See the [integration docs][timescale] to create a pipeline to store monitoring
  event metrics with TimescaleDB.

  integrations now provide more robust event handling with automated retries.
  Configure the `retry_limit` and `retry_delay` attributes to customize
  retry logic per integration or per contact.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu Enterprise 3.2 includes improved error messaging for
  a common issue with unsupported formats for private keys. See the
  [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting-guide] for information about
  identifying and resolving this error.

- **BUGFIX**: Sensu Enterprise 3.2 fixes a bug in the VictorOps integration
  that prevented events in VictorOps from resolving due to an incorrect message
  type.

Built on [Sensu Core 1.5][core-v1-5-0]:

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The built-in check dependencies filter lets you
  reduce noise by only alerting for the root cause of a given failure.
  Sensu Core 1.5 gives you the option to specify check dependencies by subscription
  instead of by client, making this useful filter even more flexible.
  See the [filter reference doc](/sensu-core/1.5/reference/filters#check-dependencies-filter) for more information.

- **BUGFIX**: Improved validation for check results created using the
  results API and the client socket. Sensu now validates check result
  attributes with the same methods used to validate check definitions.

- **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in the Sensu package that impacted user and group
  creation on Linux. Sensu now checks for an existing “sensu” user and group
  against multiple providers.

- **BUGFIX**: Sensu packages now include Ruby 2.4.4. This includes a fix
  for a bug in Ruby 2.4.1 that impacted Sensu clients on AIX.

## Enterprise 3.1.0 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-1-0}

**July 30, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.1.0 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note the

allowing you to use IAM-defined trust relationships to access a Sensu Enterprise
instance from EC2 clients across multiple AWS accounts. See the
[EC2 integration docs](../integrations/ec2#cross-account-access)
to learn about setting up cross-account access.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The PagerDuty integration now supports PagerDuty Events API v2.
See the [PagerDuty integration docs](../integrations/pagerduty) to add a v2 API key to Sensu Enterprise.
No changes are required for existing v1 API integrations using a `service_key` attribute.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Contact routing now lets you configure contacts that will receive alerts only for certain severities, giving you even more flexibility in handling and responding to alerts.
See the [contact routing docs](../contact-routing#severities) to configure contact severities.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [Sensu Core 1.4.3][core-v1-4-3].

## Enterprise 3.0.3 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-0-3}

`instance_id` was provided in [client `ec2`
attributes][ec2-client-attr]. The integration now functions as expected
when these attributes are provided.

## Enterprise 3.0.1 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-0-1}

**June 28, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.0.1 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-0-1-changes}

- **BUGFIX**: A bug in error logging for HTTP requests caused the log
  to describe errors as "unknown method to_hash" instead of providing insight
  into the actual HTTP response. Logs now include details of the HTTP
  response header in the error message.

- **BUGFIX**: A bug in the OpsGenie integration prevented Sensu Enterprise from
  creating alerts when the [client attribute][custom-client-attr]
  `environment` contained an array instead of a string. The
  integration now properly handles  `environment` values as a string
  or an array of strings.

## Enterprise 3.0.0 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-0-0}

**June 11, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.0.0 has been
   released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
   following improvements:

### IMPORTANT {#enterprise-v3-0-0-important}

This release includes potentially breaking, backwards-incompatible
changes:

- The OpsGenie Integration has been updated for the v2 Alert API. **To
  continue using the Sensu Enterprise OpsGenie integration, you must
  upgrade to Sensu Enterprise 3.0 and update your Sensu Enterprise
  configuration for OpsGenie before June 30, 2018.**

- Sensu Enterprise now depends on OpenJDK 1.8. On some platforms,
  upgrading from OpenJDK 1.7 may require access to EPEL to provide
  this version.

See the [Sensu Enterprise 3.0 upgrading documentation][3-0-upgrade] for additional
details on these important changes.

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-0-0-changes}

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [JRuby 9.1.17.0](https://www.jruby.org/2018/04/23/jruby-9-1-17-0.html)

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [Sensu Core 1.4.2][core-v1-4-2].

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Log output from Enterprise integrations now provides
  additional context for debugging, including event data, event ID and contact 
  name.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: JIRA integration search queries are now scoped within the
  appropriate project, reducing overhead when searching the server for
  existing issues.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: OpsGenie integration now supports new v2 Alert API
  features like `visible_to` and `action` attributes. See the updated
  [OpsGenie integration documentation][opsgenie-integration-doc] for
  details.

- **BUGFIX**: OpsGenie integration now uses an `overwrite_quiet_hours` attribute
  instead of `overwrites_quiet_hours`. The singular form of this attribute
  is required to achieve the desired result of overriding alert filtering that would
  otherwise prevent OpsGenie from notifying recipient(s) during their configured quiet
  hours.

- **BUGFIX**: EC2 integration now works in regions which accept only
  AWS Signature V4.

- **BUGFIX**: Enterprise integrations now gracefully handle the
  failure of individual contact notifications.

- **NEW**: Sensu Enterprise now supports running in API-only mode,
  making it possible to deploy Sensu Enterprise API instances
  which will not process events from transport queues. See [Sensu
  Enterprise
  configuration](/sensu-enterprise/3.0/configuration/#sensu-enterprise-command-line-interfaces-and-arguments)
  for details.
