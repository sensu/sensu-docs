## Enterprise 3.1.0 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-1-0}

**July 30, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.1.0 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-1-0-changes}

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The EC2 integration now supports cross-account access,
allowing you to use IAM-defined trust relationships to access a Sensu Enterprise
instance from EC2 clients across multiple AWS accounts. See the
[EC2 integration docs](../../integrations/ec2#cross-account-access)
to learn about setting up cross-account access.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The PagerDuty integration now supports PagerDuty Events API v2.
See the [PagerDuty integration docs](../../integrations/pagerduty) to add a v2 API key to Sensu Enterprise.
No changes are required for existing v1 API integrations using a `service_key` attribute.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Contact routing now lets you configure contacts that will receive alerts only for certain severities, giving you even more flexibility in handling and responding to alerts.
See the [contact routing docs](../contact-routing#severities) to configure contact severities.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [Sensu Core 1.4.3][core-v1-4-3].

## Enterprise 3.0.2 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-0-2}

**July 3, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.0.2 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-0-2-changes}

- **BUGFIX**: A bug in the EC2 integration caused errors when
`instance_id` was provided in [client `ec2`
attributes][ec2-client-attr]. The integration now functions as expected
when these attributes are provided.

## Enterprise 3.0.1 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-0-1}

**June 28, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.0.1 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-0-1-changes}

- **BUGFIX**: A bug in error logging for HTTP requests caused the log
  to describe errors as "unknown method to_hash" instead of providing insight
  into the actual HTTP response. Logs now include details of the HTTP
  response header in the error message.

- **BUGFIX**: A bug in the OpsGenie integration prevented Sensu Enterprise from
  creating alerts when the [client attribute][custom-client-attr]
  `environment` contained an array instead of a string. The
  integration now properly handles  `environment` values as a string
  or an array of strings.

## Enterprise 3.0.0 Release Notes {#enterprise-v3-0-0}

**June 11, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 3.0.0 has been
   released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
   following improvements:

### IMPORTANT {#enterprise-v3-0-0-important}

This release includes potentially breaking, backwards-incompatible
changes:

- The OpsGenie Integration has been updated for the v2 Alert API. **To
  continue using the Sensu Enterprise OpsGenie integration, you must
  upgrade to Sensu Enterprise 3.0 and update your Sensu Enterprise
  configuration for OpsGenie before June 30, 2018.**

- Sensu Enterprise now depends on OpenJDK 1.8. On some platforms,
  upgrading from OpenJDK 1.7 may require access to EPEL to provide
  this version.

See the [Sensu Enterprise 3.0 upgrading documentation][3-0-upgrade] for additional
details on these important changes.

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v3-0-0-changes}

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [JRuby 9.1.17.0](http://jruby.org/2018/04/23/jruby-9-1-17-0.html)

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [Sensu Core 1.4.2][core-v1-4-2].

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Log output from Enterprise integrations now provides
  additional context for debugging, including event data, event ID and contact 
  name.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: JIRA integration search queries are now scoped within the
  appropriate project, reducing overhead when searching the server for
  existing issues.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: OpsGenie integration now supports new v2 Alert API
  features like `visible_to` and `action` attributes. See the updated
  [OpsGenie integration documentation][opsgenie-integration-doc] for
  details.

- **BUGFIX**: OpsGenie integration now uses an `overwrite_quiet_hours` attribute
  instead of `overwrites_quiet_hours`. The singular form of this attribute
  is required to achieve the desired result of overriding alert filtering that would
  otherwise prevent OpsGenie from notifying recipient(s) during their configured quiet
  hours.

- **BUGFIX**: EC2 integration now works in regions which accept only
  AWS Signature V4.

- **BUGFIX**: Enterprise integrations now gracefully handle the
  failure of individual contact notifications.

- **NEW**: Sensu Enterprise now supports running in API-only mode,
  making it possible to deploy Sensu Enterprise API instances
  which will not process events from transport queues. See [Sensu
  Enterprise
  configuration](/sensu-enterprise/3.0/configuration/#sensu-enterprise-command-line-interfaces-and-arguments)
  for details.

## Enterprise 2.8.3 Release Notes {#enterprise-v2-8-3}

**March 7, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 2.8.3 has been
	released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
	following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v2-8-3-changes}

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Added context to JIRA integration log events, including
event/event_id and contact name.

- **BUGFIX**: Fixed an OpsGenie integration bug, now adding a contact name prefix to
OpsGenie alert aliases so alerts are deduplicated per contact.

## Enterprise 2.8.2 Release Notes {#enterprise-v2-8-2}

**February 9, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 2.8.2 has been
	released and is available for immediate download. Please note the

## Enterprise 2.8.1 Release Notes {#enterprise-v2-8-1}

**January 24, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Enterprise version 2.8.1 has been
	released and is available for immediate download. Please note the
	following improvements:

### CHANGES {#enterprise-v2-8-1-changes}

- **BUGFIX**: The OpsGenie alerting integration was accumulating additional
  tags for every event handled. One symptom of this behavior would be seeing
  alerts tagged with multiple severities. OpsGenie alert tags will now be
  unique to the Sensu. event they represent.

## Enterprise 2.8.0 Release Notes {#enterprise-v2-8-0}

- **IMPROVEMENT**: Built on [Sensu Core 1.2.0][core-v1-2-0].

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The InfluxDB and Graphite integrations now support
	event annotations, for adding Sensu event context to graphs. Any
	check, even those that do not produce metrics, can now use the
	"influxdb" and "graphite" event handlers to record their events in
	the respective time-series database.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The Slack integration now supports using an ERB
	template for notification Slack attachment text, e.g. `"filters":
	{"text": "/etc/sensu/slack_text.erb"}`.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The Email integration now supports HTML body content,
	with a configurable email content type, e.g. `"content_type":
	"text/html"`.

- **IMPROVEMENT**: The InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, and Wavefront integrations now
	support configurable tags, which get added to every metric point,
	e.g `"tags": {"dc": "us-central-1"}`

	keepalives, e.g. `"filter_ok_keepalives": true`.
