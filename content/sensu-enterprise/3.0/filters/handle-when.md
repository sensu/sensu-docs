## Overview

The `handle_when` enterprise filter is used to reduce notification "noise".
Users can define a minimum number of event `occurrences` before notifications
will be sent. Users can also specify a `reset` time, in seconds, to reset where
recurrences are counted from, to control when reminder/update notifications are
sent. By default, `occurrences` is set to `1`, and reset is `1800` (30 minutes).
The `handle_when` filter is used by all of the [enterprise third-party
integrations][1].

## Configuration

### Example(s) {#examples}

The following is an example of how to configure a check to only notify after 2
occurrences and send reminder/update notifications every 20 minutes. Sensu
Enterprise integrations and standard event handlers using the `handle_when`
enterprise filter will have events filtered unless these conditions are met.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "load_balancer_listeners": {
      "command": "check-haproxy.rb -s /var/run/haproxy.sock -A",
      "subscribers": [
        "load_balancer"
      ],
      "interval": 20,
      "handle_when": {
        "occurrences": 2,
        "reset": 1200
      }
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The following is an example of how to apply the `handle_when` enterprise filter
to a standard Sensu `pipe` handler.

_NOTE: The default values for `occurrences` and `reset` attributes can be overridden by specifying custom values in your check definitions as shown above. Specifying values for `handle_when` attributes in a handler definition will have no effect._

{
  "handlers": {
    "custom_mailer": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "custom_mailer.rb",
      "filter": "handle_when"
    }
  }
}
