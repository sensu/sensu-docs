We recommend using configuration management tools to deploy Sensu in production and at scale.

- Pin versions of Sensu-related software to ensure repeatable Sensu deployments.
- Ensure consistent configuration between Sensu backends.

The configuration management tools listed here have well-defined Sensu modules to help you get started.

## Ansible

The [Ansible][5] role to deploy and manage Sensu Go is available in the [Sensu-Go-Ansible GitHub repo][6].

## Chef

The [Chef][3] cookbook for Sensu is available in the [Sensu-Go-Chef GitHub repo][4].

[Contact us][8] for more information about Sensu + Chef.

## Puppet

The [Puppet][1] Sensu module is available in the [Sensu-Puppet GitHub repo][2].

Sensu partnered with [Tailored Automation][7] to enhance the Puppet module with new features and bug fixes.
