Sensu Go 6.9.0 provides a mix of new features, customer experience improvements, and bug fixes. The new CyberArk integration provides a new way to store your secrets, and Sensu also now supports metric tags in the Graphite plaintext protocol. Additionally, agent websocket connection log entries now include the backend name and authentication requests are now logged with their status. Under the hood, keepalive reconstructions no longer block backend startup &mdash; they now run gradually in the background &mdash; and we bumped the etcd version to 3.5.5. Last but not least, Sensu Go 6.9.0 implements a number of usability enhancements and bug fixes for the web UI.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.9.0.

- The Sensu agent now ingests Graphite Plaintext Protocol tags and converts them to Sensu metric points with tags. For example, Sensu will ingest the Graphite tag `my.series;tag1=value1 1 999999999` as a metric point with the name "my.series" and a "tag1": "value1" tag.
- Keepalive reconstruction now runs gradually in the background, which improves stability during backend startup.
- Upgraded etcd version from 3.5.4 to 3.5.5.

**FIXES:**
- ([Commercial feature][303]) In the web UI, the built-in subscriptions search query on the Entities page is now properly constructed.

- Modified keepalive startup so that etcd lease errors will not cause sensu-backend crashes.

## 6.8.1 release notes

**September 13, 2022** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.8.1, is now available for download.

Sensu Go 6.8.1 includes web UI fixes for OIDC refresh token expiry and information displayed on the Entities page, as well as a change in how check subdue begin and end times are evaluated.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.8.1.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][295]) In the web UI, OIDC refresh token requests now properly invoke the sign-in dialog instead of causing an `HTTP 404 Not Found` error.
- ([Commercial feature][295]) In the web UI, the entity list no longer displays the values of redacted labels.
- Check subdues are now evaluated as half-open intervals so that they are inclusive of the begin time and +1-second exclusive of the end time.

## 6.6.3 release notes

**December 16, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.6.3, is now available for download.

Sensu Go 6.6.3 includes improvements to reduce load on clusters and support cluster recovery, as well as a backend configuration option for specifying the internal etcd client log level. Fixes in this patch release will help prevent backend crashes when keepalive leases are revoked and when the backend cannot write to the event log file. In addition, this patch fixes issues that could result in a leaked etcd lease and keep the backend from terminating correctly.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.6.3.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- ([Commercial feature][259]) In the web UI, the default polling interval on the [entities page][261] is now 30 seconds to help reduce load on clusters. Search results for entities are limited to the first 500 matching entities. Also, the web UI response time and memory usage is substantially improved when opening the entities page in the default state (loading the first page of results, with no search filter applied).
- ([Commercial feature][259]) In the web UI, for instances that use etcd for event storage, search results for events are limited to 25,000 matching events.
- Added the [`etcd-client-log-level`][262] configuration option for setting the log level of the etcd client used internally within sensu-backend.
- The agentd daemon now starts up after all other daemons, which improves cluster recovery after the loss of a backend.
- When using external etcd (the `no-embed-etcd` backend configuration option is set to `true`), sensu-backend now crashes when its daemons do not stop within 30 seconds, which can happen due to an intentional shutdown or when database unavailability triggers an internal restart.
When using embedded etcd, sensu-backend will still try to avoid crashing to prevent member corruption.

**FIXES**

- New agent sessions no longer result in a leaked etcd lease.
- sensu-backend now prints a warning and continues instead of crashing when it cannot write to the specified event-log-file.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when keepalive leases are revoked on another backend or by an etcd operator.
- Fixed an issue that could prevent sensu-backend from terminating correctly.
- Proxy entity state is now created when it is missing and a matching entity config already exists.

## 6.6.2 release notes

**December 8, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.6.2, is now available for download.

The Sensu Go 6.6.2 patch release includes improvements in PostgreSQL health check queries and memory consumption for events and entities pages in the web UI. This release also fixes a web UI issue that provided incorrect links for cluster-wide resources.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.6.2.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- ([Commercial feature][259]) Changed the SQL operation for PostgreSQL health check queries to reduce query cost.
- ([Commercial feature][259]) In the web UI, removed **Related Entities** from individual pages for events and entities to eliminate the substantial memory consumption required to construct the list.

**FIXES**

- ([Commercial feature][259]) In the web UI, fixed an issue that provided incorrect links for cluster-wide resources. No web UI pages can show events across all namespaces.

## 6.6.1 release notes

**November 29, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.6.1, is now available for download.

This patch release removes a debugging log entry; adds cron library error information to validation errors for Check and CheckConfig resources; and fixes a web UI bug that expanded the clear silences dialog to the entire frame. In addition, Sensu now sets event timestamps when events are resolved via sensuctl or the web UI.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.6.1.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- To provide additional context, errors returned by the cron library are now included with the errors Sensu returns when validating Check and CheckConfig resources.
- Removed a debugging log entry that could cause logs to grow too big, too quickly.

**FIXES**
- ([Commercial feature][259]) In the web UI, the dialog window for clearing silences no longer expands to the entire frame.
- Sensu now sets event timestamps when you resolve events with sensuctl or in the web UI.

## 6.6.0 release notes

**November 25, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.6.0, is now available for download.

This release introduces PostgreSQL event store sorting as well as web UI improvements like support for ANSI color codes and a warning message when editing resources on a cluster with an older version than the gateway cluster. Sensu Go 6.6.0 also adds a label to logged metrics to help identify the backend that generated the metrics, logs connection errors along with context errors, and fixes a bug that could cause a backend crash in case of etcd client unavailability.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.6.0.

**IMPROVEMENTS**
- ([Commercial feature][259]) The web UI color themes are updated, and the default theme now uses cyan for elements like the left navigaton menu and breadcrumb navigation text.
- ([Commercial feature][259]) In the web UI, users now receive a warning message when they try to add or edit resources on an cluster that is running an older Sensu backend version than the gateway cluster.
- ([Commercial feature][259]) The web UI now supports ANSI color codes, which improves check output readability when it includes color.
- ([Commercial feature][259]) Added support for sorting for the PostgreSQL event store. In addition, GraphQL can now use the PostgreSQL event store to sort events and get the total event count.
- Logged metrics now include a backend label. This makes it possible to associate metrics from the [metrics log][258] file with the backend they were generated on.
- Sensu no longer applies zero values for [etcd configuration options][260]. This prevents overwriting the etcd-provided default values with null, zero, slice, or empty values.

**FIXES**
- When sensu-go cannot connect to etcd, the connection error is now logged along with context errors.
- Fixed a bug that could cause sensu-backend to crash if the BackendIDGetter encounters etcd client unavailability.

## 6.5.5 release notes

**November 22, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.5.5, is now available for download.

The Sensu Go 6.5.5 patch release adds two backend configuration options for configuring the API and web UI HTTP servers' write timeouts and three new GraphQL duration metrics for the metrics log. This release also delivers several bug fixes, including fixes for sensu-backend and sensu-agent panics and failed keepalive lease grant operations.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.5.5.

**IMPROVEMENTS**
- Added the [api-write-timeout][256] and [dashboard-write-timeout][257] backend configuration options.
These options allow you to configure the timeout for the respective HTTP servers' response writes, which is helpful when requests might take more than a few seconds to complete.
- Added graphql_duration_seconds, graphql_duration_seconds_sum, and graphql_duration_seconds_count to the [metrics log][238]. Also added objectives (0.5, 0.9, 0.99) to the graphql_duration_seconds metric.
- Added Prometheus metrics for tracking lease operations, with labels for operation type and status, and added sensu_go_lease_ops to the [metrics log][238].

**FIXES**
- Updated the assets, pipeline, and eventd duration metrics added in [Sensu Go 6.5.2][255] to use milliseconds for consistency with other duration metrics.
- Updated the /version API so that responses reflect the versions of external etcd clusters based on the first available etcd endpoint.
- Fixed a bug that could cause sensu-backend and sensu-agent to panic due to concurrent websocket writes.
- Sensu no longer logs an error when one side of a websocket tries to close a previously closed connection.
- Sensu now retries keepalive lease grant operations that fail due to rate limiting.

## 6.5.4 release notes

- Fixed a bug that prevented asset expansion errors from being handled.

## 6.5.2 release notes

**October 28, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.5.2, is now available for download.

The Sensu Go 6.5.2 patch release adds a number of metrics to provide more information about event handling and asset fetching and extraction.
In addition, this patch makes operating system environment variables accessible with JavaScript mutators and omits an extraneous attribute that appeared in web UI resource data.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.5.2.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- For JavaScript mutators, you can now list the names of any environment variables that are available in your environment (in addition to defining environment variables) in the [env_vars attribute][254].
This allows you to transform events with metatdata from the Sensu environment, which is useful for downstream processing and filtering when sending Sensu event data for further processing.
- Added sensu_go_event_handler_duration_sum and sensu_go_event_handler_duration_count and added `status` and `event_type` labels to the sensu_go_event_handler_duration metric.

## 6.5.0 release notes

**October 13, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.5.0, is now available for download.

This release includes a number of improvements, specifically exciting new capabilities in the observability pipeline and a major simplification to how "pipelines" are configured. Sensu Go 6.5.0 introduces a new first-class `Pipeline` resource for defining logical pipeline workflows composed of filters + mutators + handlers. We're also introducing new streaming handler types: a TCPStreamHandler with TLS support and a SumoLogicMetricsHandler for seamless integration with the Sumo Logic Continuous Intelligence platform. Enhancements in the web UI include a completely overhauled configuration management system (with new views for the Checks, Filters, Handlers, and Mutators pages) and behind-the-scenes improvements that pave the way for even more new configuration management capabilities in future releases. Read the full release notes below for all the details!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.5.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][229]) Added [Sensu Plus][247], a built-in integration you can use to transmit your Sensu observability data to Sumo Logic via the Sumo Logic HTTP Logs and Metrics Source.
- ([Commercial feature][229]) Added support for [Sumo Logic metrics handlers][230] and [TCP stream handlers][231]. The [enterprise/pipeline/v1 API endpoints][232] provide HTTP access for retrieving and configuring Sumo Logic metrics handlers and TCP stream handlers.
- ([Commercial feature][229]) You can now [view resource data][249] for events, entities, and configuration resources like checks and handlers directly in the web UI.
- ([Commercial feature][229]) In the web UI, you can [execute individual checks on demand][250] either according to existing subscriptions or on specific agents by adding and removing subscriptions without making changes to the saved check subscriptions.
- ([Commercial feature][229]) Added Prometheus metrics for TCP stream handlers:
    - sensu_go_tcp_stream_handler_events: Total number of events handled by the TCP stream handler
    - sensu_go_tcp_stream_handler_errors: Total number of errors produced by the TCP stream handler
    - sensu_go_tcp_stream_handler_latency: Distribution of handler latencies, in milliseconds, for the TCP stream handler
    - sensu_go_tcp_stream_handler_connection_acquisition_latency: Distribution of connection acquisition latencies (how long it takes to acquire a connection from the connection pool), in milliseconds, within the TCP stream handler
- New [pipelines][233] resource allows you to specify event filters, mutators, and handlers in a single workflow instead of listing filters and mutators in handler definitions. You can reference pipelines in your check definitions. The [`/pipelines` API endpoint][234] provides HTTP access for retrieving pipeline data and configuring pipelines, and you can use [sensuctl][235] to manage pipelines. [Upgrade your Sensu agents][1] to Sensu Go 6.5.0 to use pipelines resources.
- [JavaScript mutators][246] are now available. JavaScript mutators are evaluated by the Otto JavaScript VM as JavaScript programs, which enables greater throughput at scale than pipe mutators.
- Check definitions now include the [pipelines attribute][236] for specifying pipeline resources to use for the check's observability events.
- Added [platform metrics logging][238] to log core Sensu metrics in InfluxDB Line Protocol format, along with the `disable-platform-metrics`, `platform-metrics-log-file`, and `platform-metrics-logging-interval` backend configuration options for managing the platform metrics logging feature.
- [Event logging][237] is no longer a commercial-only feature.
- You can now set sensuctl environment variables for a [single sensuctl command][243] or with [sensuctl configure][244].

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Added environment variables `SENSU_BACKEND_ETCD_CLIENT_USERNAME` and `SENSU_BACKEND_ETCD_CLIENT_PASSWORD` for [connecting to external etcd via username and password authentication][245] instead of certificate authentication. There are no corresponding command line flags &mdash; these configuration options must be set via environment variables.
- You can now add an [API key][248] when you initialize the backend to make automated cluster setup and deployment more straightforward.
- Events now include the name of the agent that processed the event in the [`processed_by` attribute][251] to help you determine which agent processed an event executed by a proxy check request or a POST request to the events API.
- Added the [`ignore-already-initialized`][253] backend configuration option, which you can use to suppress the "already initialized" response and return an exit code 0 if a cluster has already been initialized.
- Upgraded Go version from 1.16.5 to 1.17.1.

**SECURITY:**

- Migrated [dgrijalva/jwt-go][239] to [golang-jwt/jwt][240] to address a vulnerability that would allow attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations. Read [CVE-2020-26160][241] for more information.

**FIXES:**

- Sensuctl env now properly lists `SENSU_API_KEY` and `SENSU_TIMEOUT` as options for [exporting environment variables][242]. In addition, sensuctl command exec now properly adds the `SENSU_API_KEY` and `SENSU_TIMEOUT` variables to the command's environment.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when running the backend on darwin/arm64 and compressing a wrapped resource.
- Fixed a bug that could result in an etcd error if the number of silences in a given transaction exceeded etcd's default maximum number of operations per transaction.

## 6.4.3 release notes

**September 1, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.4.3, is now available for download.

## 6.4.2 release notes

**August 31, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.4.2, is now available for download.

This patch adds a backend configuration attribute that allows parallel event log encoding, as well as two summary metrics for the /metrics API endpoint.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.4.2.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][215]) Added the [`event-log-parallel-encoders`][226] backend configuration attribute, which allows you to indicate whether Sensu should use parallel JSON encoders for event logging instead of the default (a single JSON encoding worker). This fixes a bottleneck in the event logging feature.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Added sensu_go_agentd_event_bytes and sensu_go_store_event_bytes summary metrics to the [/metrics API endpoint][227]. sensu_go_agentd_event_bytes tracks the sizes of events, in bytes, received by agentd on the backend. sensu_go_store_event_bytes tracks event sizes, in bytes, received by the etcd store on the backend.

## 6.4.1 release notes

**August 25, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.4.1, is now available for download.

This patch includes fixes that improve forward- and backward-compatibility for backends and prevent `sensuctl cluster member-list` crashes, as well as changes to the default log levels for webd, the API, and the sensu-agent.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.4.1.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][215]) For LDAP configurations, the `allowed_groups` attribute is omitted if not populated.
This change improves backend reliability with older versions of federation and sensuctl.
- Fixed a bug to prevent `sensuctl cluster member-list` crashes when the etcd response header is nil.
- Fixed a `sensu-backend init` regression that returned exit status 0 if the store was already initialized.
- Sensu Go OSS can now be built on darwin/arm64.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**
- ([Commercial feature][215]) The default webd log level is now `warn`.
- The default log level for the Sensu API and [`sensu-agent`][225] is now `warn` (instead of `info`).
- The sensu-backend now reports when it is ready to process events at the `warn` level.
- You can now create resources with fields that are unknown to Sensu.
This change improves forward-compatibility with newer Sensu backends.

## 6.4.0 release notes

**June 28, 2021** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.4.0, is now available for download.

The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.4.0, is now available for download. This release includes a number of feature improvements and important bug fixes. We upgraded the embedded etcd from version 3.3 to 3.5 for improved stability and security. The `sensu-backend init` command now supports a `wait` flag, which indicates that the backend should repeatedly try to establish a connection to etcd until it is successful -- fantastic news for Kubernetes users who want to bootstrap new Sensu Go clusters with external etcd! Check timeout also now works properly on Windows hosts: the Sensu Go agent can terminate check sub-processes on check execution timeout. This release fixes a bug that prevented deregistration events from working. There's something for everyone in this release!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.4.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][215]) In the web UI, the system information modal now includes license expiration information, accessed via the `CTRL .` keyboard shortcut, for users with the appropriate permissions.
- ([Commercial feature][215]) Added [page-specific configuration][221] options and a custom [sign-in message attribute][220] for the web UI.
- Added binary-only distribution for [macOS arm64][216].

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Added [etcd-log-level][217] backend configuration option for setting the log level for the embedded etcd server.
- Added [`wait` flag][218] for the `sensu-backend init` command, which indicates the backend should repeatedly try to establish a connection to etcd until it is successful.
- The `timeout` flag for `sensu-backend init` is now treated as a duration instead of seconds (example duration format is `10s` for 10 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes).
Values less than 1 second and integer values will be interpreted as seconds.
- Added `sensu_go_keepalives` Prometheus metric to count keepalive statuses over time and help identify instability due to keepalive failure.
- Upgraded Go version from `1.13.15` to `1.16.5`.
- Upgraded etcd version from `3.3.22` to `3.5.0`.
As a result, **6.4.0 is not backward-compatible with previous Sensu versions**.
Read the [upgrade instructions][222] for details about creating a full etcd database backup before you upgrade to Sensu Go 6.4.0.
Also, in etcd 3.5, some Prometheus metric names changed.
Read the [etcd documentation][219] for details.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][215]) Selector statements that begin with quotes no longer cause an error if they follow the `&&` operator.
- ([Commercial feature][215]) Fixed a bug that allowed PostgresConfig resources to include a namespace attribute.
Also, invalid PostgresConfig resources can no longer be created.
- Fixed a bug that resulted in OK keepalive status after shutting down the agent.

## 6.2.0 release notes

**December 17, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.2.0, is now available for download.

The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.2.0, is now available for download! Sensu Go 5.x and configuration management users rejoice: this release adds support for agent local configuration (that is, agent.yml) managed entities! Agent entities may now be managed exclusively by their agents when `sensu-agent` is started with the new `agent-managed-entity` configuration option. This makes it more straightforward to migrate from Sensu Go 5.x to 6.x, as existing agent entity management workflows like Puppet will just work with the new option enabled! Note that you will not be able to edit agent-managed entities via the backend REST API or web UI.

Sensu Go 6.2.0 includes significant feature enhancements such as PostgreSQL backend round robin check scheduling for increased reliability and consistency, an updated format for silenced entry dates and durations in sensuctl tabular-format output, and a /health API endpoint for agent WebSocket transport status. This release delivers important bug fixes like consistently using `event_id` in logs and eliminating the sensuctl error when Vault provider SSL certificates do not exist on the local system. Also, enterprise/prune/v1alpha no longer requires cluster-wide permissions; users with limited permissions can put it to use in their namespaces!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.2.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][193]) Added support for the `memberof` attribute for the [LDAP authentication provider][199].
- ([Commercial feature][193]) Added the ability to exclude resource types when using sensuctl prune with the [--omit flag][200].
- ([Commercial feature][193]) Added support for [round robin scheduling on PostgreSQL][201] instead of etcd.
- ([Commercial feature][193]) Added support for OIDC authentication via [sensuctl configure][202].
- Entities may now be [managed exclusively by their agents][204] when sensu-agent is started with the [agent-managed-entity][203] configuration attribute.
- The [/metrics API endpoint][196] now exposes build information as a Prometheus metric.
- Added /health API endpoint to agent WebSocket transport.
- Checks now include the [`scheduler` attribute][197], which Sensu automatically populates with the type of scheduler that schedules the check.
- Events now include the [`sequence` attribute][198], which the Sensu agent automatically sets at startup and increments by 1 at every successive check execution or keepalive event.
- Added support for using environment variables to define the configuration file paths for the Sensu agent (`SENSU_CONFIG_FILE`) and backend (`SENSU_BACKEND_CONFIG_FILE`).

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][193]) Refactored entity limiter to ensure that warning messages about approaching a license's entity or entity class limit are now only displayed for users with `create` or `update` permissions for the license.
- ([Commercial feature][193]) The [enterprise/prune/v1alpha API] endpoints[194] and the [sensuctl interface][195] now require less-broad permissions.
- Adjusted the format for silenced entry dates and durations in sensuctl tabular-format output. For all silenced entries, the begin date is now listed in RFC 3339 format. For silenced entries that have not begun, the list displays the expiration date in RFC 3339 format. For silenced entires with no expiration date, the list displays `-1`. For silenced entries that have begun, the list displays the duration (for example, 1m30s).
- Sensuctl and sensu-backend now ask users to retype their passwords when creating a new password in interactive mode.

**FIXES:**

- ([Commercial feature][193]) Sensuctl no longer produces an error when SSL certificates for the Vault provider do not exist on the local system.
- Logs now consistently use `event_id` rather than `event_uuid`.
- Sensuctl commands that only contain subcommands now exit with status code 46 when no arguments or incorrect arguments are given.

## 6.1.0 release notes

**October 5, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.1.0, is now available for download.

This release delivers significant performance and stability gains, feature enhancements, and several bug fixes. The web UI is now much snappier, and its search is redesigned with an improved syntax and suggestions! Monitor even more services and infrastructure when using the PostgreSQL store: batched Sensu event writes and improved indexing allows a single Sensu Go deployment to process and query more data than ever before. If you're using Prometheus client libraries to instrument your applications, the Sensu Go agent can now scrape and enrich those metrics! And if you're collecting metrics in other formats like Nagios PerfData, you can use the new output metric tags feature to enrich those metrics too! The sensuctl prune command also received some love, and it now loads and prunes configuration resources from multiple files!

## 6.0.0 release notes

**August 10, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.0.0, is now available for download.

With Sensu Go 6.0.0, you can control everything through the API. You can still use configuration management tools to bootstrap agent entities, but you don't need to! Our new agent entity management feature via the backend configuration API nearly eliminates the need for external (or out-of-band) configuration management for Sensu, which allows you to manage agent entity subscriptions and automate the discovery of system facts without updating agent local configuration files. Run a sensuctl command, click a button in the web UI, or execute a custom check plugin!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.0.0.

Other exciting additions include the ability to save and share your filtered searches in the web UI, plus a new `matches` substring match operator that you can use to refine your filtering results!
Improvements include a new `created_by` field in resource metadata and a `float_type` field that stores whether your system uses hard float or soft float.
We've also added agent and sensuctl builds for MIPS architectures, moved Bonsai logs to the `debug` level, and added PostgreSQL health information to the /health API payload.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.19.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][122]) In the [web UI][124], you can now [save, recall, and delete filtered searches][123].

## 5.17.0 release notes

**January 28, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.17.0, is now available for download.
This is a significant release, with new features, improvements, and fixes!
We're ecstatic to announce the release of secrets management, which eliminates the need to expose sensitive information in your Sensu configuration.
When a Sensu component such as a check or handler requires a secret (like a username or password), Sensu will be able to fetch that information from one or more external secrets providers (for example, HashiCorp Vault) and provide it to the Sensu component via temporary environment variables.
Secrets management allows you to move secrets out of your Sensu configuration, giving you the ability to safely and confidently share your Sensu configurations with your fellow Sensu users!
This release also includes per-entity keepalive event handler configuration, a sought-after feature for users who have migrated from Sensu 1.x to Sensu Go.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.17.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Added [HTTP API for secrets management][108], with Sensu's `Env` secrets provider and support for HashiCorp Vault secrets management. The secrets provider resource is implemented for checks, mutators, and handlers.
- Added the `keepalive-handlers` agent configuration option to specify the keepalive handlers to use for an entity's events.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Upgraded the size of the events auto-incremented ID in the PostgreSQL store to a 64-bit variant, which allows you to store many more events and avoids exhausting the sequence.
- ([Commercial feature][106]) [Initialization][109] via `sensu-backend init` is now implemented for Docker.
- ([Commercial feature][106]) UPN binding support has been re-introduced via the `default_upn_domain` configuration attribute.

- In the [web UI][107], fixed a bug that duplicated event history in the event timeline chart.
- `sensuctl command` assets installed via Bonsai now use the `sensuctl` namespace.
- Fixed a bug where failing check TTL events could occur if keepalive failures had already occurred.

## 5.16.1 release notes

**December 18, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.16.1, is now available for download.
This release fixes a performance regression that caused API latency to scale linearly as the number of connected agents increased and includes a change to display the `sensu_go_events_processed` Prometheus counter by default.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.16.1.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- The `sensu_go_events_processed` Prometheus counter now initializes with the `success` label so the count is always displayed.

**FIXES:**

- The performance regression introduced in 5.15.0 that caused API latency to scale linearly as the number of connected agents increased is fixed.

## 5.16.0 release notes

**December 16, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.16.0, is now available for download.
This is another important release, with many new features, improvements, and fixes.
We introduced an initialization subcommand for **new** installations that allows you to specify an admin username and password instead of using a pre-defined default.
We also added new backend configuration options to help you take advantage of etcd auto-discovery features and agent configuration options you can use to define a timeout period for critical and warning keepalive events.

New web UI features include a switcher that makes it easier to switch between namespaces in the dashboard, breadcrumbs on every page, OIDC authentication in the dashboard, a drawer that replaces the app bar to make more room for content, and more.

We also fixed issues with `sensuctl dump` and `sensuctl cluster health`, installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai, and missing namespaces in keepalive events and events created through the agent socket interface.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.16.0.

**IMPORTANT:**

- For Debian- and RHEL-family installations, the backend is no longer seeded with a default admin username and password.

- Added the ['sensu-backend init' subcommand][102].
- Added the [`etcd-discovery`][100] and [`etcd-discovery-srv`][292] configuration options to sensu-backend, which allow users to take advantage of the embedded etcd's auto-discovery features.
- Added the [`keepalive-critical-timeout`][101] configuration option to define the time after which a critical keepalive event should be created for an agent and the [`keepalive-warning-timeout`][101] configuration option, which is an alias of `keepalive-timeout` for backward compatibility.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][105]) The entity limit warning message is now displayed less aggressively and the warning threshold is proportional to the entity limit.
- A new switcher in the [web UI][103] makes it easier to switch namespaces in the dashboard.
Access the new component from the drawer or with the shortcut ctrl+k.
For users who have many namespaces, the switcher now includes fuzzy search and improved keyboard navigation.
- In the [web UI][103], replaced the app bar with an omnipresent drawer to increase the available space for content. Each page also now includes breadcrumbs.
- In the [Sensu documentation][104], links now point to the version of the product being run instead of the latest, which may be helpful when running an older version of Sensu.

**FIXES:**

- `sensuctl dump` help now shows the correct default value for the format flag.
- Installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai will now check for correct labels before checking if the asset has 1 or more builds.

## 5.1.0 release notes

**December 19, 2018** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.1.0, is now available for download.
This release includes an important change to the Sensu backend state directory as well as support for Ubuntu 14.04 and some key bug fixes.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.1.0.

**IMPORTANT:**

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: This applies only to Sensu backend binaries downloaded from `s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sensu.io/sensu-go`, not to Sensu RPM or DEB packages.
{{% /notice %}}

- For Sensu backend binaries, the default `state-dir` is now `/var/lib/sensu/sensu-backend` instead of `/var/lib/sensu`.
To upgrade your Sensu backend binary to 5.1.0, make sure your `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` configuration file specifies a `state-dir`.
Read the [upgrade guide][3] for more information.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- Sensu [agents][4] now include `trusted-ca-file` and `insecure-skip-tls-verify` configuration options, giving you more flexibility with certificates when connecting agents to the backend over TLS.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Sensu now includes support for Ubuntu 14.04.

**FIXES:**

- The Sensu backend now successfully connects to an external etcd cluster.
- SysVinit scripts for the Sensu agent and backend now include correct run and log paths.
- Once created, keepalive alerts and check TTL failure events now continue to occur until a successful event is observed.
- When querying for an empty list of assets, sensuctl and the Sensu API now return an empty array instead of null.
- The sensuctl `create` command now successfully creates hooks when provided with the correct definition.
- The Sensu dashboard now renders status icons correctly in Firefox.

## 5.0.1 release notes

**December 12, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Go 5.0.1 includes our top bug fixes following last week's general availability release.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.0.1.

**FIXED:**

- The Sensu backend can now successfully connect to an external etcd cluster.
- The Sensu dashboard now sorts silences in ascending order, correctly displays status values, and reduces shuffling in the event list.
- Sensu agents on Windows now execute command arguments correctly.
- Sensu agents now correctly include environment variables when executing checks.
- Command arguments are no longer escaped on Windows.
- Sensu backend environments now include handler and mutator execution requests.
