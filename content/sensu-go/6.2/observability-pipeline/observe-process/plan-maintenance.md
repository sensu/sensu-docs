As the Sensu backend processes check results, the server executes [event handlers][1] to send alerts to personnel or otherwise relay observation data (events) to external services.
Sensu’s built-in silencing, along with the built-in `not_silenced` filter, provides a way to suppress execution of event handlers on an ad hoc basis.

Use silencing to prevent handlers configured with the `not_silenced` filter from being triggered based on the check name in a check result or the subscriptions associated with the entity that published the check result.
Sensu's silencing capability allows operators to quiet incoming alerts while coordinating a response or during planned maintenance windows.

Sensu silencing makes it possible to:

* [Silence all checks on a specific entity][2]
* [Silence a specific check on a specific entity][3]
* [Silence all checks with a specific subscription][4]
* [Silence all checks for entities with a specific subscription][9]
* [Silence a specific check on entities with a specific subscription][5]
* [Silence a specific check on every entity][6]

Suppose you want to plan a maintenance window.
In this example, you'll create a silenced entry for a specific entity named `i-424242` and its check, `check-http`, to prevent alerts as you restart and redeploy the services associated with this entity.

## Create the silenced entry

To begin, create a silenced entry that will silence the check `check-http` on the entity `i-424242` for a planned maintenance window that starts at **01:00** on **Sunday** and ends **1 hour** later.
Your username will be added automatically as the **creator** of the silenced entry:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl silenced create \
--subscription 'entity:i-424242' \
--check 'check-http' \
--begin '2021-03-14 01:00:00 -04:00' \
--expire 3600 \
--reason 'Server upgrade'
{{< /code >}}

This command creates the following silenced resource definition:

{{< language-toggle >}}

{{< code yml >}}
---
type: Silenced
api_version: core/v2
metadata:
  created_by: admin
  name: entity:i-424242:check-http
  namespace: default
spec:
  begin: 1615698000
  check: check-http
  creator: admin
  expire: 3600
  expire_at: 1615701600
  expire_on_resolve: false
  reason: Server upgrade
  subscription: entity:i-424242
{{< /code >}}

{{< code json >}}
{
  "type": "Silenced",
  "api_version": "core/v2",
  "metadata": {
    "created_by": "admin",
    "name": "entity:i-424242:check-http",
    "namespace": "default"
  },
  "spec": {
    "begin": 1615698000,
    "check": "check-http",
    "creator": "admin",
    "expire": 3600,
    "expire_at": 1615701600,
    "expire_on_resolve": false,
    "reason": "Server upgrade",
    "subscription": "entity:i-424242"
  }
}
{{< /code >}}

{{< /language-toggle >}}

Read the [sensuctl documentation][8] for the supported time formats for the `begin` flag.

## Validate the silenced entry

Use sensuctl to verify that the silenced entry against the entity `i-424242` was created properly:

{{< language-toggle >}}

{{< code shell "YML" >}}
sensuctl silenced info 'entity:i-424242:check-http' --format yaml
{{< /code >}}

{{< code shell "JSON" >}}
sensuctl silenced info 'entity:i-424242:check-http' --format wrapped-json
{{< /code >}}

{{< /language-toggle >}}

The response will list the silenced resource definition.


After the silenced entry starts to take effect, events that are silenced will be marked as such in the response:

{{< code shell >}}
   Entity         Check        Output       Status     Silenced          Timestamp
──────────────   ─────────    ─────────   ──────────── ────────── ───────────────────────────────
   i-424242      check-http                    0          true     2021-03-14 13:22:16 -0400 EDT
{{< /code >}}

{{% notice warning %}}
**WARNING**: By default, a silenced event will be handled unless the handler uses the `not_silenced` filter to discard silenced events.
{{% /notice %}}
