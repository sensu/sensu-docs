## Features

- Transform metrics to TimescaleDB format: extract and transform the metrics you collect from different sources in formats like Graphite, OpenTSDB, Nagios, and Influx and populate them into TimescaleDB.
- Specify custom values for Sensu event metric points via [metric tags][3].

## Get the plugin

To build your own workflow or integrate Sensu with existing workflows, add the [Sensu TimescaleDB Handler plugin][4] with a dynamic runtime asset from Bonsai, the Sensu asset hub.
[Dynamic runtime assets][5] are shareable, reusable packages that make it easier to deploy Sensu plugins.
