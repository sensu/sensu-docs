We recommend updating Sensu frequently to stay in sync with the latest features and fixes.
Sensu uses [semantic versioning](/sensu-go/latest/release-notes/#versioning), which guarantees backwards compatibility for minor and patch releases, so you can upgrade with confidence.
See the [upgrade guide](../../installation/upgrade) to upgrade to the latest version.

Sensu supports the latest versions of official distributions, including packages, binary-only distributions, and Docker images.
Documentation for versions that have reached end of support is provided as a PDF and on [GitHub](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-docs/tree/master/content/sensu-go).
To learn more about Sensu support and licensing, see the [getting started guide](../enterprise).
