API keys are long-lived authentication tokens that make it more convenient to authenticate with Sensu-adjacent applications. API keys are generated by the Sensu backend, and you can provide them to applications that want to interact with the Sensu API.

Use the [APIKey API][1] to create, retrieve, update, and delete API keys.

## API key compatibility

API keys are 100% backward-compatible with Sensu's [authentication token system][2], but API keys do not need to be refreshed every 15 minutes like the auth tokens.

When you specify an API key in a request, the system resolves it to an authentication token and continues through the regular authentication process.

_NOTE: The API key resource is not compatible with [`sensuctl create`][3]._
