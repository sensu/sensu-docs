## What is a Sensu cluster?

A Sensu cluster is a group of [at least three][1] sensu-backend nodes, each connected to a shared etcd cluster, using Sensu's embedded etcd or an external etcd cluster. Creating a Sensu cluster ultimately configures an [etcd cluster][2].

## Why use clustering?

Clustering is important to make Sensu more highly available, reliable, and durable. It will help you cope with the loss of a backend node, prevent data loss, and distribute the network load of agents.

_NOTE: We recommend using a load balancer to evenly distribute agent connections across the cluster._

## Configuring a cluster

The sensu-backend arguments for its store mirror the [etcd configuration flags][3], however the Sensu flags are prefixed with `etcd`. For more detailed descriptions of the different arguments, you can refer to the [etcd docs][4] or the Sensu [backend reference][15].

You can configure a Sensu cluster in a couple different ways (we'll show you a few below) but it's recommended to adhere to some etcd cluster guidelines as well.

> The recommended etcd cluster size is 3, 5 or 7, which is decided by the fault tolerance requirement. A 7-member cluster can provide enough fault tolerance in most cases. While a larger cluster provides better fault tolerance, the write performance reduces since data needs to be replicated to more machines. It is recommended to have an odd number of members in a cluster. Having an odd cluster size doesn't change the number needed for majority, but you gain a higher tolerance for failure by adding the extra member *(Core OS).*

We also recommend using stable platforms to support your etcd instances (see [etcd's supported platforms][5]).

### Docker

If you'd prefer to stand up your Sensu cluster within Docker containers, check out the Sensu Go [docker configuration][7]. This configuration defines three sensu-backend containers and three sensu-agent containers.

### Traditional computer instance

_NOTE: The remainder of this guide uses on disk configuration. If you are using an ephemeral computer instance, you can use `sensu-backend start --help` to see examples of etcd command line flags. The configuration file entries below translate to `sensu-backend` flags._

#### Sensu backend configuration

Below are example configuration snippets from `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` using a three node cluster. The nodes are named `backend-1`, `backend-2` and `backend-3` with IP addresses `10.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.2` and `10.0.0.3`, respectively.

_NOTE: This backend configuration assumes you have set up and installed the sensu-backend on all the nodes used in your cluster. You can use our [installation and configuration guide][14] guide if you have not done so._

**backend-1**

etcd-initial-cluster-state: "new"
etcd-initial-cluster-token: ""
etcd-name: "backend-3"
{{< /highlight >}}

Once each node has the configuration described above, start each sensu-backend:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo systemctl start sensu-backend
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Adding sensu agents to the cluster

Each Sensu agent should have the following entries in `/etc/sensu/agent.yml` to ensure they are aware of all cluster members. This allows the agent to reconnect to a working backend if the backend it is currently connected to goes into an unhealthy state.

{{< highlight yml >}}
##
# backend-url configuration for all agents connecting to cluster over ws
##

backend-url:
  - "ws://10.0.0.1:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.2:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.3:8081"
{{< /highlight >}}

You should now have a highly available Sensu cluster! You can verify its health and try other cluster management commands using [sensuctl][6].

## Sensuctl

[Sensuctl][17] has several commands to help you manage and monitor your cluster. See `sensuctl cluster -h` for additional help usage.

### Cluster health

Get cluster health status and etcd alarm information.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster health

       ID            Name                          Error                           Healthy  
────────────────── ─────────── ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── ─────────
a32e8f613b529ad4   backend-1                                                        true
c3d9f4b8d0dd1ac9   backend-2  dial tcp 10.0.0.2:2379: connect: connection refused   false
c8f63ae435a5e6bf   backend-3                                                        true
{{< /highlight >}}

### Add a cluster member

Add a new member node to an existing cluster.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-add backend-4 https://10.0.0.4:2380

added member 2f7ae42c315f8c2d to cluster

ETCD_NAME="backend-4"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="backend-4=https://10.0.0.4:2380,backend-1=https://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=https://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=https://10.0.0.3:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
{{< /highlight >}}

### List cluster members

List the ID, name, peer urls, and client urls of all nodes in a cluster.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-list

       ID            Name             Peer URLs                Client URLs
────────────────── ─────────── ───────────────────────── ─────────────────────────
a32e8f613b529ad4   backend-1    https://10.0.0.1:2380     https://10.0.0.1:2379  
c3d9f4b8d0dd1ac9   backend-2    https://10.0.0.2:2380     https://10.0.0.2:2379
c8f63ae435a5e6bf   backend-3    https://10.0.0.3:2380     https://10.0.0.3:2379
2f7ae42c315f8c2d   backend-4    https://10.0.0.4:2380     https://10.0.0.4:2379
{{< /highlight >}}

### Remove a cluster member

Remove a faulty or decommissioned member node from a cluster.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-remove 2f7ae42c315f8c2d

Removed member 2f7ae42c315f8c2d from cluster
{{< /highlight >}}

### Replace a faulty cluster member

Here's how to replace a faulty cluster member to restore a cluster's health.

First, run `sensuctl cluster health` to identify the faulty cluster member.
For a faulty cluster member, the `Error` column will include an error message and the `Healthy` column will list `false`.

In this example, cluster member `backend-4` is faulty:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster health

       ID            Name                          Error                           Healthy  
────────────────── ─────────── ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── ─────────
a32e8f613b529ad4   backend-1                                                        true
c3d9f4b8d0dd1ac9   backend-2                                                        true
c8f63ae435a5e6bf   backend-3                                                        true
2f7ae42c315f8c2d   backend-4  dial tcp 10.0.0.4:2379: connect: connection refused   false

{{< /highlight >}}

Second, delete the faulty cluster member. To continue this example, you will delete cluster member `backend-4` using its ID field:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-remove 2f7ae42c315f8c2d

Removed member 2f7ae42c315f8c2d from cluster
{{< /highlight >}}

Third, add a newly created member to the cluster. You can use the same name and IP address as the faulty member you deleted, with one change to the configuration: specify the `etcd-initial-cluster-state` as `existing`.

{{< highlight yml >}}
etcd-advertise-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.4:2379"
etcd-listen-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.4:2379"
etcd-listen-peer-urls: "http://0.0.0.0:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster: "backend-1=http://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=http://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=http://10.0.0.3:2380,backend-4=http://10.0.0.4:2380"
etcd-initial-advertise-peer-urls: "http://10.0.0.4:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster-state: "existing"
etcd-initial-cluster-token: ""
etcd-name: "backend-4"
{{< /highlight >}}

If replacing the faulty cluster member does not resolve the problem, please see the [etcd operations guide][12] for more information.

### Update a cluster member

Update the peer URLs of a member in a cluster.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-update c8f63ae435a5e6bf https://10.0.0.4:2380

Updated member with ID c8f63ae435a5e6bf in cluster
{{< /highlight >}}

## Security

Please see our guide, [Securing Sensu][16], for more information.

## Using an external etcd cluster

Using Sensu with an external etcd cluster requires etcd 3.3.2 or newer. To stand up an external etcd cluster, you can follow etcd's [clustering guide][2] using the same store configuration.

In this example, we will enable client-to-server and peer communication authentication [using self-signed TLS certificates][13]. Below is how you would start etcd for `backend-1` from our three node configuration example above.

{{< highlight shell >}}
etcd \
--listen-client-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2379" \
--advertise-client-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2379" \
--listen-peer-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2380" \
--initial-cluster "backend-1=https://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=https://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=https://10.0.0.3:2380" \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2380" \
--initial-cluster-state "new" \
--name "backend-1" \
--trusted-ca-file=./ca.pem \
--cert-file=./backend-1.pem \
--key-file=./backend-1-key.pem \
--client-cert-auth \
--peer-trusted-ca-file=./ca.pem \
--peer-cert-file=./backend-1.pem \
--peer-key-file=./backend-1-key.pem \
--peer-client-cert-auth \
--auto-compaction-mode revision \
--auto-compaction-retention 2
{{< /highlight >}}

_NOTE: The `auto-compaction-mode` and `auto-compaction-retention` flags are of particular significance. Without these settings your database may quickly reach etcd's maximum database size limit._

In order to inform Sensu that you'd like to use this external etcd data source, add the `sensu-backend` flag `--no-embed-etcd` to the original configuration, along with the path to a client certificate created using our CA.

{{< highlight shell >}}
sensu-backend start \
--etcd-trusted-ca-file=./ca.pem \
--etcd-cert-file=./client.pem \
--etcd-key-file=./client-key.pem \
--etcd-advertise-client-urls=https://10.0.0.1:2379,https://10.0.0.2:2379,https://10.0.0.3:2379 \
--no-embed-etcd
