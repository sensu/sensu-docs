This page is a placeholder to mark a section that would be named **Contributions**.

In the updated docs architecture, this page could include information about:

- Sensu plugins and projects that are seeking contributors
- Most-requested plugins
- Known gaps in the documentation

This page could also include a showcase of contributed projects.
