**COMMERCIAL FEATURE**: Access the Env and VaultProvider secrets provider datatypes in the packaged Sensu Go distribution.
For more information, see [Get started with commercial features][20].

Sensu's secrets management allows you to avoid exposing secrets in your Sensu configuration.
In this guide, you'll learn how to use Sensu's built-in secrets provider, `Env`, and [HashiCorp Vault][1] as your external [secrets provider][2] and authenticate without exposing secrets like usernames, passwords, and access keys.

To follow this guide, youâ€™ll need to [install the Sensu backend][5], have at least one [Sensu agent][11] running, and [install and configure sensuctl][7].

Secrets are configured via [`secrets` resources][8].
A secret resource definition refers to the secrets provider (`Env` or `VaultProvider`) and an ID (the named secret to fetch from the secrets provider).

Your backend will execute a PagerDuty handler that requires your secret.
The Sensu backend will transmit a request over its secure transport (TLS-encrypted websockets) to your Sensu agent to execute your handler.

**Is this true for Vault? Even though we're using the no-TLS development server?**

Your Sensu handler will include secrets that are exposed to Sensu services at runtime as environment variables.
The `secrets` scope of the request payload and the environment variables are automatically redacted from all Sensu service logs and dashboards to prevent secret leakage.

## Use Env for secrets management

The [Sensu Go commercial distribution][1] includes a built-in secrets provider, `Env`, that exposes secrets from [environment variables][4] on your Sensu backend nodes.

### Set up your Env secrets provider

To use the `Env` secrets provider, first retrieve your PagerDuty service routing key.
This is the secret you will set up in the `Env` secrets provider.

Then, use `sensuctl create` to create your secrets provider, `env`.
In the code below, replace `SERVICE_ROUTING_KEY` with your PagerDuty service routing key.

**Is the service routing key the same as the API Integration key mentioned in PagerDuty docs at https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-events-api-keys ?**

Run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: Env
api_version: secrets/v1
metadata:
  name: env
spec:
  env_vars:
  - PAGERDUTY_KEY=SERVICE_ROUTING_KEY
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

This writes your secret into the environment variable with the ID `PAGERDUTY_KEY`.

### Create your secret

Next, use sensuctl create to create your secret.
This code creates a secret named `pagerduty_key` that refers to the environment variable ID `PAGERDUTY_KEY`.
Run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: Secret
api_version: secrets/v1
metadata:
  name: pagerduty_key
  namespace: default
spec:
  id: PAGERDUTY_KEY
  provider: env
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

Now you can securely pass your PagerDuty service routing key in Sensu checks, handlers, and mutators by referring to the `pagerduty_key` secret.
In this guide, you'll use your `pagerduty_key` secret in a [handler][19].

## Use HashiCorp Vault for secrets management

This section explains how to use [HashiCorp Vault][1] as your external [secrets provider][2] and authenticate via the HashiCorp Vault integration's [token auth method][3] or [TLS certificate auth method][4].

### Retrieve your Vault root token

You will need to set up [HashiCorp Vault][15] to use `VaultProvider` secrets management in production.
The examples in this guide use the [Vault dev server][18], which is useful for learning and experimenting.
Using the Vault dev server gives you access to a preconfigured, running Vault server with in-memory storage that you can use right away.
Follow the [HashiCorp Learn curriculum][16] when you are ready to set up a production-ready server in Vault.

To retrieve your root token:

1. Download and install the Vault edition for your OS https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads/
2. Run `vault server -dev`.
3. Find the `Root Token` value for your Vault dev server in the command output and copy it.

Leave the Vault dev server running.

### Create your Vault secrets provider

_**NOTE**: In Vault's dev server, TLS is not enabled, so you won't be able to use certificate-based authentication. The dev server also requires Vault's HTTP API version `v2`. When you use Vault in production, you will need to configure the [TLS attribute][17] and change the `version` to `v1`._

Use `sensuctl create` to create your secrets provider, `vault`.
In the code below, replace `ROOT_TOKEN` with the `Root Token` value for your Vault dev server.
Then, run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: VaultProvider
api_version: secrets/v1
metadata:
  name: vault
spec:
  client:
    address: http://localhost:8200
    token: ROOT_TOKEN
    version: v2
    tls: null
    max_retries: 2
    timeout: 20s
    rate_limiter:
      limit: 10
      burst: 100
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

### Create your secret

_**NOTE**: Because you aren't using TLS, you will need to add `export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` in your bash profile._

1. Retrieve your PagerDuty service routing key.
This is the secret you will set up in Vault.
2. Open a new terminal and run `vault kv put secret/pagerduty key=[SERVICE_ROUTING_KEY]`.
Replace `[SERVICE_ROUTING_KEY]` with your PagerDuty service routing key.

This writes your secret into Vault.
In this example, the name of the secret is `pagerduty`.
The `pagerduty` secret contains a key, and you specified that the `key` value is your PagerDuty service routing key.

**Is the service routing key the same as the API Integration key mentioned in PagerDuty docs at https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-events-api-keys ?**

The `id` value for secrets that target a HashiCorp Vault must start with the name of the secret's path in Vault.
The Vault dev server is preconfigured with the `secret` keyspace already set up, so we recommend using the `secret/` path for the `id` value while you are learning and getting started with Vault secrets management.

Run `vault kv get secret/pagerduty` to see the secret you just set up.

**STOPPED HERE FRIDAY**

Use sensuctl create to create your secret:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: Secret
api_version: secrets/v1
metadata:
  name: pagerduty_key
  namespace: default
spec:
  id: secret/pagerduty#key
  provider: vault
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

Now you can securely pass your PagerDuty service routing key in Sensu checks, handlers, and mutators by referring to the `pagerduty_key` secret.
In this guide, you'll use your `pagerduty_key` secret in a handler.

## Add a handler

This handler will **ADD**.
It will require your backend to request secrets from your secrets provider.

To create a handler definition using Sensu's built-in `Env` secret provider, run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
api_version: core/v2
type: Handler
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pagerduty
spec:
  type: pipe
  command: [NEED COMMAND HERE]
  secrets:
    - name: pagerduty_key
      secret: env
  timeout: 10
  filters:
  - is_incident
  - not_silenced
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

To create a handler definition using your HashiCorpVault secret, run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
api_version: core/v2
type: Handler
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pagerduty
spec:
  type: pipe
  command: [NEED COMMAND HERE]
  secrets:
    - name: secret/pagerduty#key
      secret: vault
  timeout: 10
  filters:
  - is_incident
  - not_silenced
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

Now your handler is set up!

## [NEXT STEP NEEDED]

**ADD: What is the next step?** We need to trigger an event (like https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/guides/email-handler/#create-and-trigger-an-ad-hoc-event) to demonstrate that this setup works.
