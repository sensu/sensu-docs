Sensu's secrets management allows you to avoid exposing secrets in your Sensu configuration.
In this guide, you'll learn how to use [HashiCorp Vault][1] as your external [secrets provider][2] and authenticate via the HashiCorp Vault integration's [token auth method][3] or [TLS certificate auth method][4].

To follow this guide, youâ€™ll need to [install the Sensu backend][5], have at least one [Sensu agent][11] running on Linux, and [install and configure sensuctl][7].

_**NOTE**: Secrets can only be passed to checks if you have configured mTLS for the agent and backend._

**ADD: Any other requirements?**

Secrets are configured via [`secrets` resources][8].
A secret resource definition refers to the secrets provider (in this guide, Vault) and an ID (the named secret to fetch from the secrets provider).

Your backend will execute a check, handler, and mutator that require your Vault secret.
The Sensu backend will transmit a request over its secure transport (TLS-encrypted websockets) to your Sensu agent to execute your check.
Your backend will also use fetched secrets to execute your handler and mutator.

**ADD: What will the check, handler, and mutator do?**

## Create your secrets provider

**I'm not sure whether the secrets provider or the secrets should come first.**

To create your secrets provider `vault`, send a PUT request to the [`/providers/:provider` API endpoint][13].

{{< highlight shell >}}
curl -X PUT \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $SENSU_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "type": "VaultProvider",
  "api_version": "secrets/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "vault"
  },
  "spec": {
    "client": {
      "address": "https://vaultserver.example.com:8200",
      "token": "VAULT_TOKEN",
      "version": "v1",
      "tls": {
        "ca_cert": "/etc/ssl/certs/vault_ca_cert.pem"
      },
      "max_retries": 2,
      "timeout": "20s",
      "rate_limiter": {
        "limit": 10.0,
        "burst": 100
      }
    }
  }
}' \

## Create your secrets

To create your secrets provider `vault`, send a PUT request to the [`/secrets/:secret` API endpoint][14].

Secrets that target a HashiCorp Vault must start with the word `secret`.
In this example, the name of the secret is `ansible`.
The `ansible` secret contains a value called `token`, which is the password to our database.

{{< highlight shell >}}
curl -X PUT \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $SENSU_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "type": "Secret",
  "api_version": "secrets/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "VAULT_TOKEN",
    "namespace": "default"
  },
  "spec": {
    "id": "secret/ansible#token",
    "provider": "vault"
  }
}' \

## Add a check, handler, and mutator

Here's an overview of how the check, handler, and mutator will work:

- The check will **ADD**.
- The handler will **ADD**.
- The mutator will **ADD**.
- All three will require your backend to request secrets from your HashiCorp Vault secrets provider.

**Unsure what might be a realistic and useful example to use here. How should the check, handler, and mutator work together?**

Secrets are exposed to Sensu services at runtime as environment variables.
The `secrets` scope of the request payload and the environment variables are automatically redacted from all Sensu service logs and dashboards to prevent secret leakage.

**Is the above true for Vault secrets?**

The Sensu backend will cache fetched secrets in memory, with no persistence to a Sensu datastore or file on disk.
Sensu deletes secrets provided via a lease with a [lease duration][12] from Sensu's in-memory cache after the configured number of seconds, prompting the Sensu backend to request the secret again.

**I borrowed the examples from the check, handler, and mutator references as placeholders below.**

First, to create the check, run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: CheckConfig
api_version: core/v2
metadata:
  name: ansible-tower
  namespace: ops
spec:
  check_hooks: null
  command: sensu-ansible.sh $VAULT_TOKEN
  secrets:
  - name: VAULT_TOKEN
    secret: sensu-vault-token
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, create the handler definition. Run:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: Handler 
api_version: core/v2 
metadata:
  name: ansible-tower
  namespace: ops
spec: 
  type: pipe
  command: sensu-ansible-handler -h $VAULT_HOST -t $VAULT_TOKEN
  secrets:
  - name: VAULT_HOST
    secret: sensu-vault-host
  - name: VAULT_TOKEN
    secret: sensu-vault-token
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

Third, create the mutator definition:

{{< highlight shell >}}
cat << EOF | sensuctl create
---
type: Mutator 
api_version: core/v2 
metadata:
  name: ansible-tower
  namespace: ops
spec: 
  command: sensu-ansible-mutator -h $VAULT_HOST -t $VAULT_TOKEN
  secrets:
  - name: VAULT_HOST
    secret: sensu-vault-host
  - name: VAULT_TOKEN
    secret: sensu-vault-token
EOF
{{< /highlight >}}

Now your check, handler, and mutator are set up!

## [NEXT STEP NEEDED]

**ADD: What is the next step?** I think we should also trigger an event (like https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/guides/email-handler/#create-and-trigger-an-ad-hoc-event) to demonstrate that this setup works.

## Next steps
