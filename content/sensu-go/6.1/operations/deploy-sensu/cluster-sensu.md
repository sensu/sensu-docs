To deploy Sensu for use outside of a local development environment, first decide whether you want to run a Sensu cluster.

A Sensu cluster is a group of at least three sensu-backend nodes, each connected to a shared database provided either by Sensu’s embedded etcd or an external etcd cluster.
Creating a Sensu cluster ultimately configures an [etcd cluster][2].

Clustering improves Sensu's availability, reliability, and durability.
It allows you to absorb the loss of a backend node, prevent data loss, and distribute the network load of agents.
If you have a healthy clustered backend, you only need to make [Sensu API][20] calls to any one of the cluster members.
The cluster protocol will replicate your changes to all cluster members.

Scaling a single backend to a cluster or migrating a cluster from cleartext HTTP to encrypted HTTPS without downtime can require [a number of tedious steps][14].
For this reason, we recommend that you **decide whether your deployment will require clustering as part of your initial planning effort**.

No matter whether you deploy a single backend or a clustered configuration, begin by securing Sensu with transport layer security (TLS).
The first step in setting up TLS is to [generate the certificates you need][13].
Then, follow our [Secure Sensu][16] guide to make Sensu production-ready.

After you've secured Sensu, continue reading this document to [set up][2] and [update][1] a clustered configuration.

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: We recommend using a load balancer to evenly distribute agent connections across a cluster.

## Configure a cluster

The sensu-backend arguments for its store mirror the [etcd configuration flags][3], but the Sensu flags are prefixed with `etcd`.
For more detailed descriptions of the different arguments, see the [etcd documentation][4] or the [Sensu backend reference][15].

You can configure a Sensu cluster in a couple different ways &mdash; we'll show you a few below &mdash; but you should adhere to some etcd cluster guidelines as well:

> The recommended etcd cluster size is 3, 5 or 7, which is decided by the fault tolerance requirement. A 7-member cluster can provide enough fault tolerance in most cases. While a larger cluster provides better fault tolerance, the write performance reduces since data needs to be replicated to more machines. It is recommended to have an odd number of members in a cluster. Having an odd cluster size doesn't change the number needed for majority, but you gain a higher tolerance for failure by adding the extra member. *[etcd2 Admin Guide][18]*

We also recommend using stable platforms to support your etcd instances (see [etcd's supported platforms][5]).

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: If a cluster member is started before it is configured to join a cluster, the member will persist its prior configuration to disk.
For this reason, you must remove any previously started member's etcd data by stopping sensu-backend and deleting the contents of `/var/lib/sensu/sensu-backend/etcd` before proceeding with cluster configuration.
{{% /notice %}}

### Docker

If you prefer to stand up your Sensu cluster within Docker containers, check out the Sensu Go [Docker configuration][7].
This configuration defines three sensu-backend containers and three sensu-agent containers.

### Traditional computer instance

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: The remainder of this guide describes on-disk configuration.
If you are using an ephemeral computer instance, you can use `sensu-backend start --help` to see examples of etcd command line flags.
The configuration file entries in the rest of this guide translate to `sensu-backend` flags.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Sensu backend configuration

{{% notice warning %}}
**WARNING**: You must update the default configuration for Sensu's embedded etcd with an explicit, non-default configuration to secure etcd communication in transit.
If you do not properly configure secure etcd communication, your Sensu configuration will be vulnerable to unauthorized manipulation via etcd client connections.
{{% /notice %}}

The examples in this section are configuration snippets from `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` using a three-node cluster.
The nodes are named `backend-1`, `backend-2` and `backend-3` with IP addresses `10.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.2` and `10.0.0.3`, respectively.

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: This backend configuration assumes you have set up and installed the sensu-backend on all the nodes used in your cluster.
Follow the [Install Sensu](../install-sensu/) guide if you have not already done this.
{{% /notice %}}

**Store configuration for backend-1/10.0.0.1**

{{< code yml >}}
etcd-advertise-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.1:2379"
etcd-listen-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.1:2379"
etcd-listen-peer-urls: "http://0.0.0.0:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster: "backend-1=http://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=http://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=http://10.0.0.3:2380"
etcd-initial-advertise-peer-urls: "http://10.0.0.1:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster-state: "new"
etcd-initial-cluster-token: "unique_token_for_this_cluster"
etcd-name: "backend-1"
{{< /code >}}

**Store configuration for backend-2/10.0.0.2**

{{< code yml >}}
etcd-advertise-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.2:2379"
etcd-listen-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.2:2379"
etcd-listen-peer-urls: "http://0.0.0.0:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster: "backend-1=http://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=http://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=http://10.0.0.3:2380"

etcd-initial-cluster-state: "new"
etcd-initial-cluster-token: "unique_token_for_this_cluster"
etcd-name: "backend-2"
{{< /code >}}

**Store configuration for backend-3/10.0.0.3**

{{< code yml >}}
etcd-advertise-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.3:2379"
etcd-listen-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.3:2379"
etcd-listen-peer-urls: "http://0.0.0.0:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster: "backend-1=http://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=http://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=http://10.0.0.3:2380"

etcd-initial-cluster-state: "new"
etcd-initial-cluster-token: "unique_token_for_this_cluster"
etcd-name: "backend-3"
{{< /code >}}

{{% notice warning %}}
**WARNING**: To properly secure etcd communication, replace the default URLs for `etcd-advertise-client-urls`, `etcd-listen-client-urls`, `etcd-listen-peer-urls`, and `etcd-initial-cluster` in the store configurations for your backends with non-default values.<br><br>
Specify the same `etcd-initial-cluster-token` value for all three backends.
This allows etcd to generate unique cluster IDs and member IDs even for clusters that have otherwise identical configurations and prevents cross-cluster-interaction.
{{% /notice %}}

After you configure each node as described in these examples, start each sensu-backend:

{{< code shell >}}
sudo systemctl start sensu-backend
{{< /code >}}

##### Add Sensu agents to clusters

Each Sensu agent should have the following entries in `/etc/sensu/agent.yml` to ensure the agent is aware of all cluster members.
This allows the agent to reconnect to a working backend if the backend it is currently connected to goes into an unhealthy state.

Here is an example backend-url configuration for all agents connecting to the cluster over WebSocket:

{{< code yml >}}
backend-url:
  - "ws://10.0.0.1:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.2:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.3:8081"
{{< /code >}}

You should now have a highly available Sensu cluster!
Confirm cluster health and try other cluster management commands with [sensuctl][6].

## Manage and monitor clusters with sensuctl

[Sensuctl][17] includes several commands to help you manage and monitor your cluster.
Run `sensuctl cluster -h` for additional help information.

### Get cluster health status

Get cluster health status and etcd alarm information:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster health
{{< /code >}}

The cluster health response will list the health status for each cluster member, similar to this example:

{{< code shell >}}
       ID            Name                          Error                           Healthy  
────────────────── ─────────── ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── ─────────
a32e8f613b529ad4   backend-1                                                        true
c3d9f4b8d0dd1ac9   backend-2  dial tcp 10.0.0.2:2379: connect: connection refused   false
c8f63ae435a5e6bf   backend-3                                                        true
{{< /code >}}

### Add a cluster member

To add a new member node to an existing cluster:

1. Configure the new node's store in its `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` configuration file.
For the new node `backend-4` with IP address `10.0.0.4`:

   {{< code yml >}}
etcd-advertise-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.4:2379"
etcd-listen-client-urls: "http://10.0.0.4:2379"
etcd-listen-peer-urls: "http://0.0.0.0:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster: "backend-1=http://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=http://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=http://10.0.0.3:2380,backend-4=http://10.0.0.4:2380"
etcd-initial-advertise-peer-urls: "http://10.0.0.4:2380"
etcd-initial-cluster-state: "existing"
etcd-initial-cluster-token: "unique_token_for_this_cluster"
etcd-name: "backend-4"
{{< /code >}}

   {{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: To make sure the new member is added to the correct cluster, specify the same `etcd-initial-cluster-token` value that you used for the other members in the cluster.

Also, when you are adding a cluster member, make sure the `etcd-initial-cluster-state` value is `existing`, **not** `new`.
{{% /notice %}}

2. Run the sensuctl command to add the new cluster member:

   {{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-add backend-4 http://10.0.0.4:2380
{{< /code >}}

   You will receive a sensuctl response to confirm that the new member was added:

   {{< code shell >}}
added member 2f7ae42c315f8c2d to cluster
{{< /code >}}

3. Start the new backend:

   {{< code shell >}}
sudo systemctl start sensu-backend
{{< /code >}}

4. Add the new cluster member's WebSocket backend-url in `/etc/sensu/agent.yml` for all agents that connect to the cluster over WebSocket:

   {{< code yml >}}
backend-url:
  - "ws://10.0.0.1:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.2:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.3:8081"
  - "ws://10.0.0.4:8081"
{{< /code >}}

### List cluster members

List the ID, name, peer URLs, and client URLs of all nodes in a cluster:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-list
{{< /code >}}

You will receive a sensuctl response that lists all cluster members:

{{< code shell >}}
       ID            Name             Peer URLs                Client URLs
────────────────── ─────────── ───────────────────────── ─────────────────────────
a32e8f613b529ad4   backend-1    http://10.0.0.1:2380      http://10.0.0.1:2379  
c3d9f4b8d0dd1ac9   backend-2    http://10.0.0.2:2380      http://10.0.0.2:2379
c8f63ae435a5e6bf   backend-3    http://10.0.0.3:2380      http://10.0.0.3:2379
2f7ae42c315f8c2d   backend-4    http://10.0.0.4:2380      http://10.0.0.4:2379
{{< /code >}}

### Remove a cluster member

Remove a faulty or decommissioned member node from a cluster:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-remove 2f7ae42c315f8c2d
{{< /code >}}

You will receive a sensuctl response to confirm that the cluster member was removed:

{{< code shell >}}
Removed member 2f7ae42c315f8c2d from cluster
{{< /code >}}

### Replace a faulty cluster member

To replace a faulty cluster member to restore a cluster's health:

1. Get cluster health status and etcd alarm information:
{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster health
{{< /code >}}

    In the response, for a faulty cluster member, the Error column will include an error message and the Healthy column will list `false`.
    In this example, the response indicates that cluster member `backend-4` is faulty:
{{< code shell >}}
       ID            Name                          Error                           Healthy  
────────────────── ─────────── ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── ─────────
a32e8f613b529ad4   backend-1                                                        true
c3d9f4b8d0dd1ac9   backend-2                                                        true
c8f63ae435a5e6bf   backend-3                                                        true
2f7ae42c315f8c2d   backend-4  dial tcp 10.0.0.4:2379: connect: connection refused   false

{{< /code >}}

2. Remove the faulty cluster member &mdash; in this example, `backend-4` &mdash; using its ID.
Removing the faulty cluster member prevents the cluster size from growing.
{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-remove 2f7ae42c315f8c2d
{{< /code >}}

    The response should indicate that the cluster member was removed:
{{< code shell >}}
Removed member 2f7ae42c315f8c2d from cluster
{{< /code >}}

3. Follow the steps in [Add a cluster member][22] to configure the replacement cluster member.
{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: You can use the same name and IP address as the removed faulty member for the replacement cluster member.
When updating the replacement member's backend configuration file, make sure the `etcd-initial-cluster-state` value is `existing`, **not** `new`.
{{% /notice %}}

If replacing the faulty cluster member does not resolve the problem, see the [etcd operations guide][12] for more information.

### Update a cluster member

Update the peer URLs of a member in a cluster:

{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster member-update c8f63ae435a5e6bf http://10.0.0.4:2380
{{< /code >}}

You will receive a sensuctl response to confirm that the cluster member was updated:

{{< code shell >}}
Updated member with ID c8f63ae435a5e6bf in cluster
{{< /code >}}

## Cluster security

See [Secure Sensu][16] for information about cluster security.

## Use an external etcd cluster

{{% notice warning %}}
**WARNING**: You must update the example configuration for external etcd with an explicit, non-default configuration to secure etcd communication in transit.
If you do not properly configure secure etcd communication, your Sensu configuration will be vulnerable to unauthorized manipulation via etcd client connections.
{{% /notice %}}

To use Sensu with an external etcd cluster, you must have etcd 3.3.2 or newer.
To stand up an external etcd cluster, follow etcd's [clustering guide][2] using the same store configuration.
Do not configure external etcd in Sensu via backend command line flags or the backend configuration file (`/etc/sensu/backend.yml`).

In this example, you will enable client-to-server and peer communication authentication [using self-signed TLS certificates][13].
To start etcd for `backend-1` based on the [three-node configuration example][19]:

{{< code shell >}}
etcd \
--listen-client-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2379" \
--advertise-client-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2379" \
--listen-peer-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2380" \
--initial-cluster "backend-1=https://10.0.0.1:2380,backend-2=https://10.0.0.2:2380,backend-3=https://10.0.0.3:2380" \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls "https://10.0.0.1:2380" \
--initial-cluster-state "new" \
--name "backend-1" \
--trusted-ca-file=./ca.pem \
--cert-file=./backend-1.pem \
--key-file=./backend-1-key.pem \
--client-cert-auth \
--peer-trusted-ca-file=./ca.pem \
--peer-cert-file=./backend-1.pem \
--peer-key-file=./backend-1-key.pem \
--peer-client-cert-auth \
--auto-compaction-mode revision \
--auto-compaction-retention 2
{{< /code >}}

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: The `auto-compaction-mode` and `auto-compaction-retention` flags are important.
Without these settings, your database may quickly reach etcd's maximum database size limit.
{{% /notice %}}

To tell Sensu to use this external etcd data source, add the `sensu-backend` flag `--no-embed-etcd` to the original configuration, along with the path to a client certificate created using your CA:

{{< code shell >}}
sensu-backend start \
--etcd-trusted-ca-file=./ca.pem \
--etcd-cert-file=./client.pem \
--etcd-key-file=./client-key.pem \
--etcd-client-urls=https://10.0.0.1:2379 https://10.0.0.2:2379 https://10.0.0.3:2379 \
--no-embed-etcd
{{< /code >}}

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: The `etcd-client-urls` value must be a space-delimited list or a YAML array.
{{% /notice %}}

## Troubleshoot clusters

### Failure modes

See the [etcd failure modes documentation][8] for information about cluster failure modes.

### Disaster recovery

See the [etcd recovery guide][9] for disaster recovery information.

### Redeploy a cluster

To redeploy a cluster due to an issue like loss of quorum among cluster members, etcd corruption, or hardware failure, read [Remove and redeploy a cluster][23].
