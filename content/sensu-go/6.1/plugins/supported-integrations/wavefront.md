## Features

- Transform metrics to Wavefront format: extract and transform the metrics you collect from different sources in formats like Graphite, OpenTSDB, Nagios, and Influx and populate them into Wavefront.
- Specify additional tags to include when processing metrics with the Wavefront plugin's `tags` flag or [metric tags][7].
- Keep your Graphite host and port secure with Sensu [environment variables and secrets management][6].
