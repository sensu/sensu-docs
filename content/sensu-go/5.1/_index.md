Sensu is the industry leading solution for multi-cloud monitoring at scale. The Sensu monitoring event pipeline empowers businesses to automate their monitoring workflows and gain deep visibility into their multi-cloud environments. Founded in 2017, Sensu offers a comprehensive monitoring solution for enterprises, providing complete visibility across every system, every protocol, every time â€” from Kubernetes to bare metal.
**Get started now and feel the #monitoringlove:** [Learn Sensu Go][1].

Sensu Go is the latest version of Sensu, designed to be more portable, easier and faster to deploy, and (even more) friendly to containerized and ephemeral environments.

**Automate your monitoring workflows**: Limitless pipelines let you validate and correlate events, [mutate data formats][20], [send alerts][21], manage incidents, [collect and store metrics][22], and more.

<img alt="Sensu event pipeline diagram" title="Sensu lets you take monitoring events from your system and use pipelines to take the right action for your workflow." src="/images/pipeline-ce.svg">

**Reduce alert fatigue**: Sensu gives you full control over your alerts with flexible [filters][18], [context-rich notifications][19], reporting, [event handling][27], and auto-remediation.

**Integrate anywhere**: Sensu's open architecture makes it easy to integrate monitoring with tools you already use like Nagios plugins, Chef, Graphite, InfluxDB, and PagerDuty.

### Monitoring for Your Infrastructure

> Monitoring is the action of observing and checking the behaviors and outputs of a system and its components over time. - [Greg Poirier, Monitorama 2016](https://vimeo.com/173610062)

Sensu is an agent-based monitoring tool that you install on your organization's infrastructure.
The Sensu agent gives you visibility into everything you care about; the Sensu server gives you flexible, automated workflows to route metrics and alerts.

- **Monitor containers, instances, applications, and on-premises infrastructure**

Sensu is designed to monitor everything from the server closet to the cloud.
[Install the Sensu agent][15] on the hosts you want to monitor, integrate with the [Sensu API][23], or take advantage of [proxy entities][17] to monitor anything on your network.
Sensu agents automatically register and de-register themselves with the Sensu server, so you can monitor ephemeral infrastructure without getting overloaded with alerts.

- **Better incident response with filterable, context-rich alerts**

Get meaningful alerts when and where you need them.
Use [event filters][18] to reduce noise and [check hooks][19] to add context and speed up incident response.
Sensu integrates with the tools and services your organization already uses like [PagerDuty][31], [Slack][29], and more.
Check out [Bonsai, the Sensu asset index][30], or write your own [Sensu Plugins][9] in any language.

- **Collect and store metrics with built-in support for industry-standard tools**

Know what's going on everywhere in your system.
Sensu supports industry-standard [metric formats][20] like Nagios Performance Data, Graphite Plaintext Protocol, InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDB Data Specification, and [StatsD metrics][24].
Use the Sensu agent to collect metrics alongside check results, then use the event pipeline to route the data to a time series database like [InfluxDB][6].

- **Intuitive API and dashboard interfaces**

Sensu includes a [dashboard][25] to provide a unified view of your entities, checks, and events, as well as a user-friendly silencing tool.
The [Sensu API][23] and the [`sensuctl` command-line tool][26] allow you (and your internal customers) to create checks, register entities, manage configuration, and more.

- **Open core software backed by Sensu Inc.**

Sensu Go's core is open source software, freely available under a
permissive [MIT License][12] and publicly available on [GitHub][13].
