### Versioning
Sensu Go adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH release numbers, starting at 5.0.0. MAJOR version changes indicate incompatible API changes; MINOR versions add backwards-compatible functionality; PATCH versions include backwards-compatible bug fixes.

### Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version of Sensu Go from version 5.0.0 or later, first [install the latest packages][8].

Then restart the services.

_NOTE: For systems using `systemd`, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` before restarting the services._

{{< highlight shell >}}
# Restart the Sensu agent
sudo service sensu-agent restart

# Restart the Sensu backend
sudo service sensu-backend restart
{{< /highlight >}}

You can use the `version` command to determine the installed version using the `sensu-agent`, `sensu-backend`, and `sensuctl` tools. For example: `sensu-backend version`.

## 5.1.0 Release Notes

**December 19, 2018** &mdash; We’re excited to announce the first minor version release of Sensu Go.
This release includes an important change to the Sensu backend state directory as well as support for Ubuntu 14.04 and some key bug fixes.
A big thank you to all our users who have found bugs in Sensu Go so far!
We're looking forward to bringing you even more bug fixes and new features in 2019.

### CHANGES {#5.1.0-changes}

- **IMPORTANT**: This applies only to Sensu backend binaries downloaded from `s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sensu.io/sensu-go`, not to Sensu RPM or DEB packages. For Sensu backend binaries, the default `state-dir` is now `/var/lib/sensu/sensu-backend` instead of `/var/lib/sensu`. To upgrade your Sensu backend binary to 5.1.0, make sure your `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` configuration file specifies a `state-dir`. See the [upgrade guide][10] for more information.
- **ADDED**: Sensu [agents][9] now include `trusted-ca-file` and `insecure-skip-tls-verify` configuration flags, giving you more flexibility with certificates when connecting agents to the backend over TLS.
- **ADDED**: Sensu now includes support for Ubuntu 14.04.
- **FIXED**: The Sensu backend now successfully connects to an external etcd cluster without creating a panic.
- **FIXED**: SysVinit scripts for the Sensu agent and backend now include correct run and log paths.
- **FIXED**: Once created, keepalive alerts and check TTL failure events now continue to occur until a successful event is observed.
- **FIXED**: When querying for an empty list of assets, sensuctl and the Sensu API now return an empty array instead of null.
- **FIXED**: The sensuctl `create` command now successfully creates hooks when provided with the correct definition.
- **FIXED**: The Sensu dashboard now renders status icons correctly in Firefox.

## 5.0.1 Release Notes

**December 12, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Go 5.0.1 includes our top bug fixes following last week's general availability release.

### CHANGES {#5.0.1-changes}

- **FIXED**: The Sensu backend can now successfully connect to an external etcd cluster.
- **FIXED**: The Sensu dashboard now sorts silencing entries in ascending order, correctly displays status values, and reduces shuffling in the event list.
- **FIXED**: Sensu agents on Windows now execute command arguments correctly.
- **FIXED**: Sensu agents now correctly include environment variables when executing checks.
- **FIXED**: Command arguments are no longer escaped on Windows.
- **FIXED**: Sensu backend environments now include handler and mutator execution requests.

## 5.0.0 Release Notes

**December 5, 2018** &mdash; It’s here! This marks the inaugural stable release of Sensu Go. 

We’ve got a lot of awesome functionality and new features to share. Here are a few highlights:

- Updated [Sensu UI][1] built in with the backend 
- [sensuctl][2], our new command-line tool for managing all things Sensu 
- A slick new versioned [API][3]
- True multi-tenancy with the switch to [namespaces][4] and [RBAC][5], modeled after Kubernetes 
- Enhanced [event filtering][6] with JavaScript for managing event flows 
- Object metadata, which replaces custom attributes and offers a richer way to interact with your data 
- Built-in support for [StatsD metric collection][7] 
- Embedded transport and etcd datastore to replace RabbitMQ and Redis

All this and more is included in our general availability [release changelog][changelog] and [announcement][blog].
The team has been working incredibly hard for two years, and we couldn’t be more excited to get this awesome, next-gen product into your hands! 

Happy monitoring, 

The Sensu Team
