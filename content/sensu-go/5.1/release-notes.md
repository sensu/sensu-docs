### Versioning
Sensu Go adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH release numbers, starting at 5.0.0. MAJOR version changes indicate incompatible API changes; MINOR versions add backwards-compatible functionality; PATCH versions include backwards-compatible bug fixes.

### Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version of Sensu Go from version 5.0.0 or later, first [install the latest packages][8].

Then restart the services.

_NOTE: For systems using `systemd`, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` before restarting the services._

{{< highlight shell >}}
# Restart the Sensu agent
sudo service sensu-agent restart

# Restart the Sensu backend
sudo service sensu-backend restart
{{< /highlight >}}

You can use the `version` command to determine the installed version using the `sensu-agent`, `sensu-backend`, and `sensuctl` tools. For example: `sensu-backend version`.

## 5.1.0 Release Notes

**December 19, 2018** &mdash; We’re excited to announce the latest version of Sensu Go! Please read on for the detailed release goodness and peruse the changelog [here][changelog].

### Upgrading Instructions:

For 5.1.0, we made necessary breaking changes that will require upgrade instructions in some cases:

- For Sensu backend binaries, the default `state-dir` in 5.1.0 is now `/var/lib/sensu/sensu-backend` instead of `/var/lib/sensu`.
  To upgrade your Sensu backend binary to 5.1.0, first [download the latest version][install], then make sure the `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` configuration file specifies a `state-dir`.
  To continue using `/var/lib/sensu` as the `state-dir`, add the following configuration to `/etc/sensu/backend.yml`.

_NOTE: This only affects users who are not using the provided RPM or DEB packages, or who do not have an existing `state-dir` setting in their `/etc/sensu/backend.yml`._

See the [upgrade guide][10] for more information.

### CHANGES {#5.1.0-changes}

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

  - Added support for Ubuntu 14.04
  - Agents have been updated to include configuration flags to give you greater flexibility with certificates when connecting to the backend over TLS. 

**FIXES:**

  - The Sensu backend now successfully connects to an external etcd cluster without creating a panic.
  - SysVinit scripts for the Sensu agent and backend now include correct run and log paths.
  - Once created, keepalive alerts and check TTL failure events now continue to occur until a successful event is observed.
  - When querying for an empty list of assets, sensuctl and the Sensu API now return an empty array instead of `null`.
  - The sensuctl `create` command now successfully creates hooks when provided with the correct definition.
  - The Sensu dashboard now renders status icons correctly in Firefox.

We love to hear from you! Please feel free to reach out to us [here][contact].
