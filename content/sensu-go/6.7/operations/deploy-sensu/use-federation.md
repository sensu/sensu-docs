**COMMERCIAL FEATURE**: Access federation in the packaged Sensu Go distribution.
For more information, read [Get started with commercial features](../../../commercial/).
{{% /notice %}}

Sensu's [enterprise/federation/v1 API endpoints][1] allow you to register external clusters, gain single-pane-of-glass visibility into the health of your infrastructure and services across multiple distinct Sensu instances within the web UI, and mirror your changes in one cluster to follower clusters.
This is useful when you want to provide a single entry point for Sensu users who need to manage monitoring across multiple distinct physical data centers, cloud regions, or providers.

{{< figure src="/images/go/use_federation/federation_switcher_660.gif" alt="Animated demonstration of federated views in Sensu Web UI" link="/images/go/use_federation/federation_switcher_660.gif" target="_blank" >}}

After you configure federation, you can also create, update, and delete clusters using sensuctl [create][5], [edit][6], and [delete][7] commands.

Federation is not enabled by default.
You must create a cluster resource for the federation cluster and [register it][14].
Only cluster administrators can register a new cluster, but every user can [query the list of clusters][11].

Complete federation of multiple Sensu instances relies on a combination of features:

| Feature                             | Purpose in federation |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication | Cross-cluster token authentication using asymmetric key encryption |
| etcd replicators                    | Replicate RBAC policy across clusters and namespaces |
| Federation Gateway and APIs         | Configure federation access for cross-cluster visibility in web UI |

Follow the example in this guide to configure these features.
The example assumes you wish to federate three named Sensu clusters:

| Cluster name | Hostname |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| `gateway` | sensu.gateway.example.com |
| `alpha` | sensu.alpha.example.com |
| `beta` | sensu.beta.example.com |

The `gateway` cluster will be the entry point for operators to manage Sensu resources in the `alpha` and `beta` clusters.
This guide assumes a single sensu-backend in each cluster, but named clusters composed of multiple sensu-backends are supported.

This diagram depicts the federation relationship documented in this guide:

{{< figure src="/images/go/use_federation/example_federation.png" alt="Diagram depicting this guide's example federation architecture" link="/images/go/use_federation/example_federation.png" target="_blank" >}}
<!-- Federation diagram source: https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/1b676df9-534e-40e4-9881-6313013ecd28/n~8S.VTyl5JQ -->

Complete the steps in this guide to browse events, entities, checks, and other resources in the `gateway`, `alpha`, and `beta` clusters from the `gateway` cluster web UI.

## Requirements

Because federation depends on communication with multiple disparate clusters, working TLS is required for successful federated operation.

To ensure that cluster members can validate each other, certificates for each cluster member should include the IP addresses or hostnames specified in the values of sensu-backend `etcd-advertise-client-urls`, `etcd-advertise-peer-urls`, and `etcd-initial-advertise-peer-urls` parameters.
In addition to the certificate's [Common Name (CN)][15], [Subject Alternative Names (SANs)][16] are also honored for validation.

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: As of [Go 1.15](https://golang.google.cn/doc/go1.15#commonname), certificates must include their CN as an SAN field.
To prevent connection errors, follow [Generate certificates](../generate-certificates/) to make sure your certificates' SAN fields include their CNs.
{{% /notice %}}

To continue with this guide, make sure you have the required TLS credentials in place:

* A PEM-formatted X.509 certificate and corresponding private key copied to each cluster member.
* A corresponding certificate authority (CA) certificate chain copied to each cluster member.

If you don't have existing infrastructure for issuing certificates, read [Generate certificates][13] for our recommended self-signed certificate issuance process.

This prerequisite extends to configuring the following Sensu backend etcd parameters:

| Backend property             | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `etcd-cert-file`             | Path to certificate used for TLS on etcd client/peer communications (for example, `/etc/sensu/tls/backend-1.example.com.pem`.  |
| `etcd-key-file`              | Path to key corresponding with `etcd-cert-file` certificate (for example, `/etc/sensu/tls/backend-1-key.example.com.pem`. |
| `etcd-trusted-ca-file`       | Path to CA certificate chain file (for example, `/etc/sensu/tls/ca.pem`. This CA certificate chain must be usable to validate certificates for all backends in the federation. |
| `etcd-client-cert-auth`      | Enforces certificate validation to authenticate etcd replicator connections. Set to `true` to secure etcd communication. |
| `etcd-advertise-client-urls` | List of https URLs to advertise for etcd replicators, accessible by other backends in the federation (for example, `https://sensu.beta.example.com:2379`). |
| `etcd-listen-client-urls`    | List of https URLs to listen on for etcd replicators (for example, `https://0.0.0.0:2379` to listen on port 2379 across all ipv4 interfaces). |

{{% notice warning %}}
**WARNING**: You *must* provide an explicit, non-default etcd configuration to secure etcd communication in transit.
If you do not properly configure secure etcd communication, your Sensu configuration will be vulnerable to unauthorized manipulation via etcd client connections.<br><br>
This includes providing non-default values for the `etcd-advertise-client-urls` and `etcd-listen-client-urls` backend parameters and creating a [certificate and key](../generate-certificates/) for the `etcd-cert-file` and `etcd-key-file` values.
The default values are not suitable for use under federation.

## Configure shared token signing keys

Whether federated or standalone, Sensu backends issue JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to users upon successful authentication.
These tokens include a payload that describes the username and group affiliations.
The payload is used to determine permissions based on the configured RBAC policy.

In a federation of Sensu backends, each backend needs to have the same public/private key pair.
These asymmetric keys are used to crypotgraphically vouch for the user's identity in the JWT payload.
Using shared JWT keys enables clusters to grant users access to Sensu resources according to their local policies but without requiring user resources to be present uniformly across all clusters in the federation.

By default, a Sensu backend automatically generates an asymmetric key pair for signing JWTs and stores it in the etcd database.
When configuring federation, you must generate keys as files on disk so they can be copied to all backends in the federation.

1. Use the `openssl` command line tool to generate a P-256 elliptic curve private key:
{{< code shell >}}
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out jwt_private.pem
{{< /code >}}

2. Generate a public key from the private key:
{{< code shell >}}
openssl ec -in jwt_private.pem -pubout -out jwt_public.pem
{{< /code >}}

3. Save the JWT keys in `/etc/sensu/certs` on each cluster backend.

4. Add the `jwt-private-key-file` and `jwt-public-key-file` attributes in `/etc/sensu/backend.yml` and specify the paths to the JWT private and public keys:
{{< code yml >}}
jwt-private-key-file: /etc/sensu/certs/jwt_private.pem
jwt-public-key-file: /etc/sensu/certs/jwt_public.pem
{{< /code >}}

5. Restart the Sensu backend so that your settings take effect:
{{< code shell >}}
sudo systemctl restart sensu-backend
{{< /code >}}

## Add a user and a cluster role binding

To test your configuration, provision a user and a cluster role binding in the `gateway` cluster.

1. Confirm that sensuctl is configured to communicate with the `gateway` cluster:
{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl config view
{{< /code >}}

    The response will list the active configuration:
{{< code text >}}
=== Active Configuration
API URL:   https://sensu.gateway.example.com:8080
Namespace: default
Format:    tabular
Username:  admin
{{< /code >}}

2. Create a `federation-viewer` user:
{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl user create federation-viewer --interactive
{{< /code >}}

3. When prompted for username and groups, press enter.

4. When prompted for password, enter a password for the `federation-viewer` user.
Make a note of the password you entered &mdash; you'll use it to log in to the web UI after you configure RBAC policy replication and registered clusters into your federation.

    This creates the following user:
{{< language-toggle >}}
{{< code text "YML" >}}
username: federation-viewer
disabled: false
{{< /code >}}
{{< code text "JSON" >}}
{
  "username": "federation-viewer",
  "disabled": false
}
{{< /code >}}
{{< /language-toggle >}}

5. Grant the `federation-viewer` user read-only access with a cluster role binding for the built-in `view` cluster role:
{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster-role-binding create federation-viewer-readonly --cluster-role=view --user=federation-viewer
{{< /code >}}

    This command creates the following cluster role binding resource definition:
{{< language-toggle >}}
{{< code yml >}}
---
type: ClusterRoleBinding
api_version: core/v2
metadata:
  created_by: admin
  name: federation-viewer-readonly
spec:
  role_ref:
    name: view
    type: ClusterRole
  subjects:
  - name: federation-viewer
    type: User
{{< /code >}}
{{< code json >}}
{
  "type": "ClusterRoleBinding",
  "api_version": "core/v2",
  "metadata": {
    "created_by": "admin",
    "name": "federation-viewer-readonly"
  },
  "spec": {
    "role_ref": {
      "name": "view",
      "type": "ClusterRole"
    },
    "subjects": [
      {
        "name": "federation-viewer",
        "type": "User"
      }
    ]
  }
}
{{< /code >}}
{{< /language-toggle >}}

## Create etcd replicators

Etcd replicators use the [etcd make-mirror utility][12] for one-way replication of Sensu RBAC policy resources.
This allows you to centrally define RBAC policy on the `gateway` cluster and replicate RBAC resources to other clusters in the federation (`alpha` and `beta`), ensuring consistent permissions for Sensu users across multiple clusters via the `gateway` web UI.

1. Configure one etcd replicator per cluster for each RBAC policy resource, across all namespaces, for each backend in the federation.
{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: Create a replicator for each resource type you want to replicate.
Replicating `namespace` resources will **not** replicate the Sensu resources that belong to those namespaces.<br><br>
The etcd replicators reference includes [examples](../etcdreplicators#etcd-replicator-examples) you can follow for `Role`, `RoleBinding`, `ClusterRole`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources.
{{% /notice %}}

    In this example, the following etcd replicator resources will replicate ClusterRoleBinding resources from  the `gateway` cluster to the two target clusters:
{{< language-toggle >}}
{{< code yml >}}

api_version: federation/v1
type: EtcdReplicator
metadata:
  name: AlphaClusterRoleBindings
spec:
  ca_cert: "/etc/sensu/certs/ca.pem"
  cert: "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway.pem"
  key: "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway-key.pem"
  url: https://sensu.alpha.example.com:2379
  api_version: core/v2
  resource: ClusterRoleBinding
  replication_interval_seconds: 30
{{< /code >}}
{{< code json >}}
{
  "api_version": "federation/v1",
  "type": "EtcdReplicator",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "AlphaClusterRoleBindings"
  },
  "spec": {
    "ca_cert": "/etc/sensu/certs/ca.pem",
    "cert": "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway.pem",
    "key": "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway-key.pem",
    "url": "https://sensu.alpha.example.com:2379",
    "api_version": "core/v2",
    "resource": "ClusterRoleBinding",
    "replication_interval_seconds": 30
  }
}
{{< /code >}}
{{< /language-toggle >}}
{{< language-toggle >}}
{{< code yml >}}
---
api_version: federation/v1
type: EtcdReplicator
metadata:
  name: BetaClusterRoleBindings
spec:
  ca_cert: "/etc/sensu/certs/ca.pem"
  cert: "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway.pem"
  key: "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway-key.pem"
  url: https://sensu.beta.example.com:2379
  api_version: core/v2
  resource: ClusterRoleBinding
  replication_interval_seconds: 30
{{< /code >}}
{{< code json >}}
{
  "api_version": "federation/v1",
  "type": "EtcdReplicator",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "BetaClusterRoleBindings"
  },
  "spec": {
    "ca_cert": "/etc/sensu/certs/ca.pem",
    "cert": "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway.pem",
    "key": "/etc/sensu/certs/gateway-key.pem",
    "url": "https://sensu.beta.example.com:2379",
    "api_version": "core/v2",
    "resource": "ClusterRoleBinding",
    "replication_interval_seconds": 30
  }
}
{{< /code >}}
{{< /language-toggle >}}

2. Run `sensuctl config view` and verify that `sensuctl` is configured to talk to a `gateway` cluster API.
Reconfigure `sensuctl` if needed.

3. Save the `AlphaClusterRoleBindings` and `BetaClusterRoleBindings` EtcdReplicator definitions to a file (for example, `etcdreplicators.yml` or `etcdreplicators.json`).

4. Use `sensuctl create -f` to apply the `AlphaClusterRoleBindings` and `BetaClusterRoleBindings` EtcdReplicator definitions to the `gateway` cluster:
{{< language-toggle >}}
{{< code shell "YML" >}}
sensuctl create -f etcdreplicators.yml
{{< /code >}}
{{< code shell "JSON" >}}
sensuctl create -f etcdreplicators.json
{{< /code >}}
{{< /language-toggle >}}

5. Verify that the EtcdReplicator resource is working as expected: reconfigure the sensuctl backend URL to communicate with the `alpha` and `beta` clusters and run the following command for each:
{{< code shell >}}
sensuctl cluster-role-binding info federation-viewer-readonly
{{< /code >}}

    The `federation-viewer-readonly` binding you created in the previous section should be listed in the output from each cluster:
{{< code text >}}
=== federation-viewer-readonly
Name:         federation-viewer-readonly
Cluster Role: view
Subjects:
  Users:      federation-viewer
{{< /code >}}

## Register clusters

Clusters must be registered to become visible in the web UI.
Each registered cluster must have a name and a list of one or more cluster member URLs corresponding to the backend REST API.

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: Individual cluster resources may list the API URLs for a single stand-alone backend or multiple backends that are members of the same etcd cluster.
Creating a cluster resource that lists multiple backends that do not belong to the same cluster will result in unexpected behavior.
{{% /notice %}}

### Register a single cluster

With `sensuctl` configured for the `gateway` cluster, run `sensuctl create` on the yaml or JSON below to register cluster `alpha`:

{{< language-toggle >}}

{{< code yml >}}
api_version: federation/v1
type: Cluster
metadata:
  name: alpha
spec:
  api_urls:
  - https://sensu.alpha.example.com:8080
{{< /code >}}

{{< code json >}}
{
  "api_version": "federation/v1",
  "type": "Cluster",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "alpha"
  },
  "spec": {
    "api_urls": [
      "https://sensu.alpha.example.com:8080"
    ]
  }
}
{{< /code >}}

{{< /language-toggle >}}

### Register additional clusters

With `sensuctl` configured for `gateway` cluster, run `sensuctl create` on the yaml or JSON below to register an additional cluster and define the name as `beta`:

{{< language-toggle >}}

{{< code yml >}}
api_version: federation/v1
type: Cluster
metadata:
  name: beta
spec:
  api_urls:
  - https://sensu.beta.example.com:8080
{{< /code >}}

{{< code json >}}
{
  "api_version": "federation/v1",
  "type": "Cluster",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "beta"
  },
  "spec": {
    "api_urls": [
      "https://sensu.alpha.example.com:8080"
    ]
  }
}
{{< /code >}}

{{< /language-toggle >}}

{{% notice note %}}
**NOTE**: When logging into the `gateway` cluster web UI, any namespaces, entities, events, and other resources specific to that cluster will be labeled as `local-cluster`.
{{% /notice %}}

## Get a unified view of all your clusters in the web UI

After you create clusters using enterprise/federation/v1 API endpoints, you can log in to the `gateway` Sensu web UI to view them as the `federation-viewer` user.
Use the namespace switcher to change between namespaces across federated clusters:

{{< figure src="/images/go/use_federation/federation_namespace_switcher_660.gif" alt="Animated demonstration of federated views in Sensu Web UI" link="/images/go/use_federation/federation_namespace_switcher_660.gif" target="_blank" >}}

Because the `federation-viewer` user is granted only permissions provided by the built-in `view` role, this user should be able to view all resources across all clusters but should not be able to make any changes.
If you haven't changed the permissions of the default `admin` user, that user should be able to view, create, delete, and update resources across all clusters.
