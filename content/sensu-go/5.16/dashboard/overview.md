### Accessing the dashboard
After [starting the Sensu backend][1], you can access the dashboard in your browser
by visiting http://localhost:3000. You may need to replace `localhost` with the
hostname or IP address where the Sensu backend is running.

### Signing in
Sign in to the dashboard with your [sensuctl][2] username and password.
See the [role-based access control reference][3] for [default user credentials][4] and instructions for [creating new users][5].

### Namespaces
The dashboard displays events, entities, checks, and silences for a single namespace at a time.
By default, the dashboard displays the `default` namespace.
To switch namespaces, select the menu icon in the upper-left corner, and choose a namespace from the dropdown.
**COMMERCIAL FEATURE**: The namespaces listed will be limited to those that the current user has access to.
